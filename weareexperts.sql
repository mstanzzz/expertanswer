Only one man knows who created them&mdash;and he\\''s not talking. Photo: Dan Winters The strangest monument in America looms over a barren knoll in northeastern Georgia. Five massive slabs of polished granite rise out of the earth in a star pattern. The rocks are each 16 feet tall, with four of them weighing more than 20 tons apiece. Together they support a 25,000-pound capstone. Approaching the edifice, it\\''s hard not to think immediately of England\\''s Stonehenge or possibly the ominous monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Built in 1980, these pale gray rocks are quietly awaiting the end of the world as we know it.</p>\r\n<p>Called the Georgia Guidestones, the monument is a mystery&mdash;nobody knows exactly who commissioned it or why. The only clues to its origin are on a nearby plaque on the ground&mdash;which gives the dimensions and explains a series of intricate notches and holes that correspond to the movements of the sun and stars&mdash;and the \\"guides\\" themselves, directives carved into the rocks. These instructions appear in eight languages ranging from English to Swahili and reflect a peculiar New Age ideology. Some are vaguely eugenic (guide reproduction wisely&mdash;improving fitness and diversity); others prescribe standard-issue hippie mysticism (prize truth&mdash;beauty&mdash;love&mdash;seeking harmony with the infinite).</p>\r\n<p>What\\''s most widely agreed upon&mdash;based on the evidence available&mdash;is that the Guidestones are meant to instruct the dazed survivors of some impending apocalypse as they attempt to reconstitute civilization. Not everyone is comfortable with this notion. A few days before I visited, the stones had been splattered with polyurethane and spray-painted with graffiti, including slogans like \\"Death to the new world order.\\" This defacement was the first serious act of vandalism in the Guidestones\\'' history, but it was hardly the first objection to their existence. In fact, for more than three decades this uncanny structure in the heart of the Bible Belt has been generating responses that range from enchantment to horror. Supporters (notable among them Yoko Ono) have praised the messages as a stirring call to rational thinking, akin to Thomas Paine\\''s The Age of Reason. Opponents have attacked them as the Ten Commandments of the Antichrist.</p>\r\n<p>Whoever the anonymous architects of the Guidestones were, they knew what they were doing: The monument is a highly engineered structure that flawlessly tracks the sun. It also manages to engender endless fascination, thanks to a carefully orchestrated aura of mystery. And the stones have attracted plenty of devotees to defend against folks who would like them destroyed. Clearly, whoever had the monument placed here understood one thing very well: People prize what they don\\''t understand at least as much as what they do.</p>\r\n<p>The story of the Georgia Guidestones began on a Friday afternoon in June 1979, when an elegant gray-haired gentleman showed up in Elbert County, made his way to the offices of Elberton Granite Finishing, and introduced himself as Robert C. Christian. He claimed to represent \\"a small group of loyal Americans\\" who had been planning the installation of an unusually large and complex stone monument. Christian had come to Elberton&mdash;the county seat and the granite capital of the world&mdash;because he believed its quarries produced the finest stone on the planet.</p>\r\n<p>Joe Fendley, Elberton Granite\\''s president, nodded absently, distracted by the rush to complete his weekly payroll. But when Christian began to describe the monument he had in mind, Fendley stopped what he was doing. Not only was the man asking for stones larger than any that had been quarried in the county, he also wanted them cut, finished, and assembled into some kind of enormous astronomical instrument.</p>\r\n<p>What in the world would it be for? Fendley asked. Christian explained that the structure he had in mind would serve as a compass, calendar, and clock. It would also need to be engraved with a set of guides written in eight of the world\\''s major languages. And it had to be capable of withstanding the most catastrophic events, so that the shattered remnants of humanity would be able to use those guides to reestablish a better civilization than the one that was about to destroy itself.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Monumental Precision</strong></p>\r\n<p>Built to survive the apocalypse, the Georgia Guidestones are not merely instructions for the future&mdash;the massive granite slabs also function as a clock, calendar, and compass.</p>\r\n<p>The monument sits at the highest point in Elbert County and is oriented to track the sun\\''s east-west migration year-round. On an equinox or solstice, visitors who stand at the west side of the \\"mail slot\\" are positioned to see the sun rise on the horizon. An eye-level hole drilled into the center support stone allows stargazers on the south side to locate Polaris, the North Star. A 7/8-inch hole drilled through the capstone focuses a sunbeam on the center column and at noon pinpoints the day of the year.Text: Erik Malinowski; illustration: Steve Sanford</p>\r\n<p>Fendley is now deceased, but shortly after the Guidestones went up, an Atlanta television reporter asked what he was thinking when he first heard Christian\\''s plan. \\"I was thinking, \\''I got a nut in here now. How am I going get him out?\\''\\" Fendley said. He attempted to discourage the man by quoting him a price several times higher than for any project commissioned there before. The job would require special tools, heavy equipment, and paid consultants, Fendley explained. But Christian merely nodded and asked how long it would take. Fendley didn\\''t rightly know&mdash;six months, at least. He wouldn\\''t be able to even consider such an undertaking, he added, until he knew it could be paid for. When Christian asked whether there was a banker in town he considered trustworthy, Fendley saw his chance to unload the strange man and sent him to look for Wyatt Martin, president of the Granite City Bank.</p>\r\n<p>The tall and courtly Martin&mdash;the only man in Elberton besides Fendley known to have met R. C. Christian face-to-face&mdash;is now 78. \\"Fendley called me and said, \\''A kook over here wants some kind of crazy monument,\\''\\" Martin says. \\"But when this fella showed up he was wearing a very nice, expensive suit, which made me take him a little more seriously. And he was well-spoken, obviously an educated person.\\" Martin was naturally taken aback when the man told him straight out that R. C. Christian was a pseudonym. He added that his group had been planning this secretly for 20 years and wanted to remain anonymous forever. \\"And when he told me what it was he and this group wanted to do, I just about fell over,\\" Martin says. \\"I told him, \\''I believe you\\''d be just as well off to take the money and throw it out in the street into the gutters.\\'' He just sort of looked at me and shook his head, like he felt kinda sorry for me, and said, \\''You don\\''t understand.\\''\\"</p>\r\n<p>Martin led Christian down the street to the town square, where the city had commissioned a towering Bicentennial Memorial Fountain, which included a ring of 13 granite panels, each roughly 2 by 3 feet, signifying the original colonies. \\"I told him that was about the biggest project ever undertaken around here, and it was nothing compared to what he was talking about,\\" Martin says. \\"That didn\\''t seem to bother him at all.\\" Promising to return on Monday, the man went off to charter a plane and spend the weekend scouting locations from the air. \\"By then I half believed him,\\" Martin says.</p>\r\n<p>When Christian came back to the bank Monday, Martin explained that he could not proceed unless he could verify the man\\''s true identity and \\"get some assurance you can pay for this thing.\\" Eventually, the two negotiated an agreement: Christian would reveal his real name on the condition that Martin promise to serve as his sole intermediary, sign a confidentiality agreement pledging never to disclose the information to another living soul, and agree to destroy all documents and records related to the project when it was finished. \\"He said he was going to send the money from different banks across the country,\\" Martin says, \\"because he wanted to make sure it couldn\\''t be traced. He made it clear that he was very serious about secrecy.\\"</p>\r\n<p>Before leaving town, Christian met again with Fendley and presented the contractor with a shoe box containing a wooden model of the monument he wanted, plus 10 or so pages of detailed specifications. Fendley accepted the model and instructions but remained skeptical until Martin phoned the following Friday to say he had just received a $10,000 deposit. After that, Fendley stopped questioning and started working. \\"My daddy loved a challenge,\\" says Fendley\\''s daughter, Melissa Fendley Caruso, \\"and he said this was the most challenging project in the history of Elbert County.\\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Construction of the Guidestones</strong></p>\r\n<p>Construction of the Guidestones got under way later that summer. Fendley\\''s company lovingly documented the progress of the work in hundreds of photographs. Jackhammers were used to gouge 114 feet into the rock at Pyramid Quarry, searching for hunks of granite big enough to yield the final stones. Fendley and his crew held their breath when the first 28-ton slab was lifted to the surface, wondering if their derricks would buckle under the weight. A special burner (essentially a narrowly focused rocket motor used to cut and finish large blocks of granite) was trucked to Elberton to clean and size the stones, and a pair of master stonecutters was hired to smooth them.</p>\r\n<p>Fendley and Martin helped Christian find a suitable site for the Guidestones in Elbert County: a flat-topped hill rising above the pastures of the Double 7 Farms, with vistas in all directions. For $5,000, owner Wayne Mullinex signed over a 5-acre plot. In addition to the payment, Christian granted lifetime cattle-grazing rights to Mullinex and his children, and Mullinex\\''s construction company got to lay the foundation for the Guidestones.</p>\r\n<p>With the purchase of the land, the Guidestones\\'' future was set. Christian said good-bye to Fendley at the granite company office, adding, \\"You\\''ll never see me again.\\" Christian then turned and walked out the door&mdash;without so much as a handshake.</p>\r\n<p>From then on, Christian communicated solely through Martin, writing a few weeks later to ask that ownership of the land and monument be transferred to Elbert County, which still holds it. Christian reasoned that civic pride would protect it over time. \\"All of Mr. Christian\\''s correspondence came from different cities around the country,\\" Martin says. \\"He never sent anything from the same place twice.\\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Daybreak</strong></p>\r\n<p>Daybreak: A carefully cut slot in the Guidestones\\'' center column frames the sunrise on solstices and equinoxes.</p>\r\n<p>Photo: Dan WintersThe astrological specifications for the Guidestones were so complex that Fendley had to retain the services of an astronomer from the University of Georgia to help implement the design. The four outer stones were to be oriented based on the limits of the sun\\''s yearly migration. The center column needed two precisely calibrated features: a hole through which the North Star would be visible at all times, and a slot that was to align with the position of the rising sun during the solstices and equinoxes. The principal component of the capstone was a 7\\\\8-inch aperture through which a beam of sunlight would pass at noon each day, shining on the center stone to indicate the day of the year.</p>\r\n<p>The main feature of the monument, though, would be the 10 dictates carved into both faces of the outer stones, in eight languages: English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, and Swahili. A mission statement of sorts (let these be guidestones to an age of reason) was also to be engraved on the sides of the capstone in Egyptian hieroglyphics, classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Babylonian cuneiform. The United Nations provided some of the translations (including those for the dead languages), which were stenciled onto the stones and etched with a sandblaster.</p>\r\n<p>By early 1980, a bulldozer was scraping the Double 7 hilltop to bedrock, where five granite slabs serving as a foundation were laid out in a paddle-wheel design. A 100-foot-tall crane was used to lift the stones into place. Each of the outer rocks was 16 feet 4 inches high, 6 feet 6 inches wide, and 1 foot 7 inches thick. The center column was the same (except only half the width), and the capstone measured 9 feet 8 inches long, 6 feet 6 inches wide, and 1 foot 7 inches thick. Including the foundation stones, the monument\\''s total weight was almost 240,000 pounds. Covered with sheets of black plastic in preparation for an unveiling on the vernal equinox, the Guidestones towered over the cattle that continued to graze beneath it at the approach of winter\\''s end.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Controversy</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The monument ignited controversy before it was even finished. The first rumor began among members of the Elberton Granite Association, jealous of the attention being showered on one of their own: Fendley was behind the whole thing, they said, aided by his friend Martin, the banker. The gossip became so poisonous that the two men agreed to take a lie detector test at the Elberton Civic Center. The scandal withered when The Elberton Star reported that they had both passed convincingly, but the publicity brought a new wave of complaints. As word of what was being inscribed spread, Martin recalls, even people he considered friends asked him why he was doing the devil\\''s work. A local minister, James Travenstead, predicted that \\"occult groups\\" would flock to the Guidestones, warning that \\"someday a sacrifice will take place here.\\" Those inclined to agree were hardly discouraged by Charlie Clamp, the sandblaster charged with carving each of the 4,000-plus characters on the stones: During the hundreds of hours he spent etching the guides, Clamp said, he had been constantly distracted by \\"strange music and disjointed voices.\\"</p>\r\n<p>The team that built the Guidestones didn\\''t know who was financing the project&mdash;just that it was the biggest monument in county history. Local banker Wyatt Martin inspects the English lettering with sandblaster Charlie Clamp before the 1980 unveiling.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Unveiling</strong></p>\r\n<p>The unveiling on March 22, 1980, was a community celebration. Congressmember Doug Barnard, whose district contained Elberton, addressed a crowd of 400 that flowed down the hillside and included television news crews from Atlanta. Soon Joe Fendley was the most famous Elbertonian since Daniel Tucker, the 18th-century minister memorialized in the folk song \\"Old Dan Tucker.\\" Bounded by the Savannah and Broad rivers but miles from the nearest interstate&mdash;\\"as rural as rural can be,\\" in the words of current Star publisher Gary Jones&mdash;Elberton was suddenly a tourist destination, with visitors from all over the world showing up to see the Guidestones. \\"We\\''d have people from Japan and China and India and everywhere wanting to go up and see the monument,\\" Martin says. And Fendley\\''s boast that he had \\"put Elberton on the map\\" was affirmed literally in spring 2005, when National Geographic Traveler listed the Guidestones as a feature in its Geotourism MapGuide to Appalachia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Physicist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty</strong></p>\r\n<p>But many who read what was written on the stones were unsettled. Guide number one was, of course, the real stopper: maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. There were already 4.5 billion people on the planet, meaning eight out of nine had to go (today it would be closer to 12 out of 13). This instruction was echoed and expanded by tenet number two: guide reproduction wisely&mdash;improving fitness and diversity. It didn\\''t take a great deal of imagination to draw an analogy to the practices of, among others, the Nazis. Guide number three instructed readers to unite humanity with a living new language. This sent a shiver up the spine of local ministers who knew that the Book of Revelations warned of a common tongue and a one-world government as the accomplishments of the Antichrist. Guide number four&mdash;rule passion&mdash;faith&mdash;tradition&mdash;and all things with tempered reason&mdash;was similarly threatening to Christians committed to the primacy of faith over all. The last six guides were homiletic by comparison. protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. avoid petty laws and useless officials. balance personal rights with social duties. prize truth&mdash;beauty&mdash;love&mdash;seeking harmony with the infinite. be not a cancer on the earth&mdash;leave room for nature&mdash;leave room for nature.</p>\r\n<p>Even as locals debated the relative merits of these commandments, the dire predictions of Travenstead seemed to be coming true. Within a few months, a coven of witches from Atlanta adopted the Guidestones as their home away from home, making weekend pilgrimages to Elberton to stage various pagan rites (\\"dancing and chanting and all that kind of thing,\\" Martin says) and at least one warlock-witch marriage ceremony. No humans were sacrificed on the altar of the stones, but there are rumors that several chickens were beheaded. A 1981 article in the monthly magazine UFO Report cited Naunie Batchelder (identified in the story as \\"a noted Atlanta psychic\\") as predicting that the true purpose of the guides would be revealed \\"within the next 30 years.\\" Viewed from directly overhead, the Guidestones formed an X, the piece in UFO Report observed, making for a perfect landing site.</p>\r\n<p>Visitors kept coming, but after several failed investigations into the identity of R. C. Christian, the media lost interest. Curiosity flared again briefly in 1993, when Yoko Ono contributed a track called \\"Georgia Stone\\" to a tribute album for avant-garde composer John Cage, with Ono chanting the 10th and final guide nearly verbatim: \\"Be not a cancer on Earth&mdash;leave room for nature&mdash;leave room for nature.\\" A decade later, however, when comedienne Roseanne Barr tried to work a bit on the Guidestones into her comeback tour, nobody seemed to care.</p>\r\n<p>Christian kept in touch with Martin, writing the banker so regularly that they became pen pals. Occasionally, Christian would call from a pay phone at the Atlanta airport to say he was in the area, and the two would rendezvous for dinner in the college town of Athens, a 40-mile drive west of Elberton. By this time, Martin no longer questioned Christian\\''s secrecy. The older man had successfully deflected Martin\\''s curiosity when the two first met, by quoting Henry James\\'' observations of Stonehenge: \\"You may put a hundred questions to these rough-hewn giants as they bend in grim contemplation of their fallen companions, but your curiosity falls dead in the vast sunny stillness that enshrouds them.\\" Christian \\"never would tell me a thing about this group he belonged to,\\" Martin says. The banker received his last letter from Christian right around the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and assumes the man&mdash;who would have been in his mid-eighties&mdash;has since passed away.</p>\r\n<p>Joe Fendley of Elberton Granite Finishing posing with his masterpiece. Photo: Courtesy of Fendley Enterprises Inc. The mysterious story of R. C. Christian and the absence of information about the true meaning of the Guidestones was bound to become an irresistible draw for conspiracy theorists and \\"investigators\\" of all kinds. Not surprisingly, three decades later there is no shortage of observers rushing to fill the void with all sorts of explanations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mark Dice</strong></p>\r\n<p>Among them is an activist named Mark Dice, author of a book called The Resistance Manifesto. In 2005, Dice (who was using a pseudonym of his own&mdash;\\"John Conner\\"&mdash;appropriated from the Terminator franchise\\''s main character) began to demand that the Guidestones be \\"smashed into a million pieces.\\" He claims that the monument has \\"a deep Satanic origin,\\" a stance that has earned him plenty of coverage, both in print and on the Web. According to Dice, Christian was a high-ranking member of \\"a Luciferian secret society\\" at the forefront of the New World Order. \\"The elite are planning to develop successful life-extension technology in the next few decades that will nearly stop the aging process,\\" Dice says, \\"and they fear that with the current population of Earth so high, the masses will be using resources that the elite want for themselves. The Guidestones are the New World Order\\''s Ten Commandments. They\\''re also a way for the elite to get a laugh at the expense of the uninformed masses, as their agenda stands as clear as day and the zombies don\\''t even notice it.\\"</p>\r\n<p>Ironically, Dice\\''s message has mainly produced greater publicity for the Guidestones. This, in turn, has brought fresh visitors to the monument and made Elbert County officials even less inclined to remove the area\\''s only major tourist attraction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vandals Attack</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Phyllis Brooks, who runs the Elbert County Chamber of Commerce, pronounced herself aghast last November when the Guidestones were attacked by vandals for the first time ever. While Dice denies any involvement in the assault, he seems to have inspired it: Spray-painted on the stones were messages like \\"Jesus will beat u satanist\\" and \\"No one world government.\\" Other defacements asserted that the Council on Foreign Relations is \\"ran by the devil,\\" that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job, and that President Obama is a Muslim. The vandals also splashed the Guidestones with polyurethane, which is much more difficult to remove than paint. Despite the graffiti\\''s alignment with his views, Dice says he disapproves of the acts. \\"A lot of people were glad such a thing happened and saw it as standing up against the New World Order,\\" Dice says, \\"while others who are unhappy with the stones saw the actions as counterproductive and inappropriate.\\"</p>\r\n<p>Martin winces every time he hears Dice\\''s \\"Luciferian secret society\\" take on the Guidestones. But while he disagrees, he also admits that he doesn\\''t know for sure. \\"All I can tell you is that Mr. Christian always seemed a very decent and sincere fella to me.\\"</p>\r\n<p>Dice, of course, is far from the only person with a theory about the Guidestones. Jay Weidner, a former Seattle radio commentator turned erudite conspiracy hunter, has heavily invested time and energy into one of the most popular hypotheses. He argues that Christian and his associates were Rosicrucians, followers of the Order of the Rosy Cross, a secret society of mystics that originated in late medieval Germany and claim understanding of esoteric truths about nature, the universe, and the spiritual realm that have been concealed from ordinary people. Weidner considers the name R. C. Christian an homage to the legendary 14th-century founder of the Rosicrucians, a man first identified as Frater C.R.C. and later as Christian Rosenkreuz. Secrecy, Weidner notes, has been a hallmark of the Rosicrucians, a group that announced itself to the world in the early 17th century with a pair of anonymous manifestos that created a huge stir across Europe, despite the fact that no one was ever able to identify a single member. While the guides on the Georgia stones fly in the face of orthodox Christian eschatology, they conform quite well to the tenets of Rosicrucianism, which stress reason and endorse a harmonic relationship with nature.</p>\r\n<p>Weidner also has a theory about the purpose of the Guidestones. An authority on the hermetic and alchemical traditions that spawned the Rosicrucians, he believes that for generations the group has been passing down knowledge of a solar cycle that climaxes every 13,000 years. During this culmination, outsize coronal mass ejections are supposed to devastate Earth. Meanwhile, the shadowy organization behind the Guidestones is now orchestrating a \\"planetary chaos,\\" Weidner believes, that began with the recent collapse of the US financial system and will result eventually in major disruptions of oil and food supplies, mass riots, and ethnic wars worldwide, all leading up to the Big Event on December 21, 2012. \\"They want to get the population down,\\" Weidner says, \\"and this is what they think will do it. The Guidestones are there to instruct the survivors.\\"</p>\r\n<p>On hearing Weidner\\''s ideas, Martin shakes his head and says it\\''s \\"the sort of thing that makes me want to tell people everything I know.\\" Martin has long since retired from banking and no longer lives in Elberton, yet he\\''s still the Guidestones\\'' official&mdash;and only&mdash;secret-keeper. \\"But I can\\''t tell,\\" the old man quickly adds. \\"I made a promise.\\" Martin also made a promise to destroy all the records of his dealings with Christian, though he hasn\\''t kept that one&mdash;at least not yet. In the back of his garage is a large plastic bin (actually, the hard-sided case of an IBM computer he bought back in 1983) stuffed with every document connected to the Guidestones that ever came into his possession, including the letters from Christian.</p>\r\n<p>For years Martin thought he might write a book, but now he knows he probably won\\''t. What he also won\\''t do is allow me to look through the papers. When I ask whether he\\''s prepared to take what he knows to his grave, Martin replies that Christian would want him to do just that: \\"All along, he said that who he was and where he came from had to be kept a secret. He said mysteries work that way. If you want to keep people interested, you can let them know only so much.\\" The rest is enshrouded in the vast sunny stillness.</p>', 'normal', 0, 1604110391, 1, 18),
(10, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 'Rosicrucian Alchemy as Another Version of the Magnum Opus', 'Rosicrucian Alchemy or Hermetic Magic and Sorcery in the Golden Dawn', '<p>Rosicrucians do not practice laboratory alchemy. Rather, they mean making some sort of metaphorical elixir or powder that would help one achieve immortality. This practice as done through the Golden Dawn rituals is rooted Luciferianism.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It has always been clear that alchemy has two natures: an operative art and a psycho-spiritual. But none of this helps us unless we look at these arts through the Rosicrucian lens. This means ignoring everything else. The lens then however becomes quite narrow, as the early Rosicrucian documents appear within a very narrow timeframe, 1611 to about 1618.</p>\r\n<p>The Reformation of the Whole Wide World by Order of Apollo.</p>\r\n<p>The Fama Fraternitatis.</p>\r\n<p>The Confessio Rosae Crucis.</p>\r\n<p>The Chemical Wedding of C.R.C</p>\r\n<p>The Primacy of the Pansophic Manifestos</p>\r\n<p>After that there are also three more secondary manifestos:</p>\r\n<p>The Pandora of the Sixth Age 1617.</p>\r\n<p>The Mirror of Wisdom of the Rosy Cross 1618.</p>\r\n<p>The Pegasus of the Firmament 1620.</p>\r\n<p>A Utopian Quest for a Golden Age.</p>\r\n<p>An Educational Thesaurus Model of the Universe.</p>\r\n<p>A Hermetic Rendition of Boehme&rsquo;s Sophianic Theosophy.</p>\r\n<p>The first one of these is based on establishing a Christian utopia, or at least a Hermetic one depending on which version you read, Bruno&rsquo;s, Campanella&rsquo;s or Andrea&rsquo;s. The second is thought to be a education system from Comenius, BUT it&rsquo;s really a means to arrive to utopia, coupled with a universal divine language. The third of these is an alchemical mysticism, and sees Boehme&rsquo;s mysticism through pagan images, for example the Sophia of Boehme becomes the Venus figure who appears in the Chemical Wedding. In short Pansophy is both utopian and alchemical.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ansophy the Wisdom of the Rosy Cross</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thus the three Pansophic manifestos are expansions of the earlier works, providing us with the ACTUAL mysticism of Rosicrucians, which was not elaborated upon before. Let&rsquo;s be clear here. The mysticism of the R.C is not really clear in the three original manifestos. There is mention of alchemy, Cabalah, magic to some degree. BUT, they mostly are allegories and the actual practices or any in depth applications remain veiled.</p>\r\n<p>The Fama was based upon the Italian &lsquo;Reformation of the Whole Wide World by Order of by Apollo&rsquo; document. That document was further based on Bruno&rsquo;s version, which mentions Apollo&rsquo;s appointed Pegasus in the Firmament, awaiting him for the day of reformation. Moglings third document is called the &lsquo;Pegasus of the Firmament.&rsquo; In fact the Apollo document having these symbols and the last document of the Pegasus make for a complete series, start to finish.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the Chemical Wedding was based on another earlier document titled the Hypnoerotmachia, where also Venus appears. Mogling&rsquo;s version of his Pegasus document also draws on other elements from the same document, such as the Temple of Wisdom, which are left out in the Chemical Wedding, thus proving insider knowledge to source documents and workings.</p>\r\n<p>Pansophic manifestos tell us exactly which books to read and study, which authors to ignore and disregard as false, and which alchemical authors in particular to pay attention to. The Pegasus outlines this in particular.</p>\r\n<p>Given the insider knowledge present in the Mogling documents we, as Rosicrucian students, should take the advice given in the Pansophic manifestos quite seriously. The Pansophic manifestos show that the Rosicrucians basically left us with a reading list to bring us up to scratch. What&rsquo;s more it provides the operative alchemical system of initiation.</p>\r\n<p>The Fama directly attacks the &lsquo;godless and accursed art of gold making.&rsquo; But still the Fama goes on to say that gold making is possible, but is rather a byproduct (Parergon) rather than their main work (Ergon). So far we are not entirely sure if outer laboratory alchemy is to be disregarded though.</p>\r\n<p>The remaining parts of the manifestos don&rsquo;t help in defining the exact art of the R.C. Now we must turn to the Pansophic manifestos because we know that they are a RELIABLE source of information.</p>\r\n<p>The Pegasus tells us to pay attention to Michael Maier. That is quite interesting because Maier practiced outer laboratory alchemy. Butm Spiritual alchemy as a term has be thrown around a lot, so much so that its best to avoid its use. Today spiritual alchemy can mean anything, from Jung to Kundalini Yoga. But, we do know that Maier certainly meant something other than outer laboratory work.</p>\r\n<p>On top of a hill stands a tabernacle, showing the four letter name of God. The alchemist is titled &lsquo;cum Deo&rsquo; which means &lsquo;with God. More importantly the word Ergon appears, telling us that the Great Work is a spiritual alchemy, achieved through prayer and mysticism. Below the hill we find the Parergon, (lettered around the angel) or secondary work, being undertaken. There are two caves or openings for the Parergon. On the left the Soul Alchemy is portrayed and on the right we find Physical Alchemy. These two caves or grottos are quite important.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Winged female Sophia.</strong></p>\r\n<p>She represents the spiritual potential for the alchemist, as notice the solar and lunar potential forces merging into her, creating a kind of pregnancy. Most people know that by merging the sun and moon in alchemy you create a Mercury, but here a pregnancy occurs. Taoist alchemy also creates a divine child within the subtle forces of the inner alchemist. Boehme also states that when we achieve the Virgin in his own mysticism then Sophia will become pregnant in us and give birth to a child Christ within, making us &lsquo;sons of God&rsquo; again.</p>\r\n<p>Go into yourself, contemplate your whole fabric and artificial structure as the Heavenly Father gave it to you when He formed you after the image of the Microcosm and&hellip; Compare it with the Macrocosm.&rsquo; Truly esoteric, he applied the &lsquo;love thy neighbour&rsquo; teaching to the body.</p>\r\n<p>Ergon et Parergon Mirror of WisdomNow, brilliantly chapter 3 tells us: &lsquo;How to combine the two forms of cognition (Ergon/Parergon) in a Pansophical concordance&rsquo; then giving the ultimate KEY &lsquo;In Chapter 1 you learned about the Ergon, which is the primary goal and objective of the whole Art, while Chapter II showed you how to implement the Parergon: you must arrange this in such a way that it is in complete tune and melody with the Microcosm, the Macrocosm and the Ergon.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Thus he says the Ergon (Great Work) and Parergon (Secondary) apply to worship and some cosmic art to do with the body and its health, whereby the soul must love it as its neighbour. In his own way Mogling is letting the secrets of the brotherhood out of the box, hence he calls it the Pandora.</p>\r\n<p>The remainder of the treatise offers two letters he addressed to the R.C apparently from before he found them and a Rosicrucian allegory. The next treatise is even more telling.</p>\r\n<p>The Mirror of Wisdom of the Rosy Cross is the actual treatise for the above mystical image.</p>\r\n<p>Now if you actually read the Mirror of Wisdom carefully Mogling tells us outright that the College of the Rosy Cross, its actual location, is a place with no windows or doors, and yet is right under your nose, and is the place where all the mysticism of the Rosicrucians is carried out.</p>\r\n<p>Sophia and her pregnancy in the image we read &lsquo;Thou shalt see its theory in the figure on the page: His father Sun (which Trismegistus says), Mother Moon; he bore the wind in his belly, his nurse is the earth. This is the matter and subject of our philosophy or of our general physiology.&lsquo; PHYSIOLOGY&hellip;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly there is one more indications that speaks against the actual practice of laboratory alchemy for the making of the Philosophers Stone. He mentions that the entire figure of the hill also represents a skull. The two caves are eyes. He says that through the right eye man can &lsquo;see into eternity&rsquo; but through the left eye man can see into &lsquo;time and creatures.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>The right eye is the man in the waters, doing some sort of purification of his &lsquo;outer garment&rsquo; which is being washed, and the right eye is the alchemist laboratory, which is not only darkened but by relating it to time indicates that the outer alchemical work is limited and not eternal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p>Rosicrucian alchemy is in fact an internal art of alchemy, which should be used throughout the body, using its natural forces and correspondences to the universe. Several Rosicrucian bodies do this, particularly those using the Arcana Arcanorum, which involves sexual energies in the art of regeneration, creating both a lunar and solar body. But Mogling directly tells us that Rosicrucian alchemy is a very different art indeed.</p>\r\n<p>Borrowed from ancient occult mystories, rituals are used in masonic and other secret disciplines where Lucifer is worshiped. The worship of Molech and Baal required human sacrifice including young children. Blood sacrifices of children is still practiced today.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'normal', 0, 1604116480, 0, 0);

Joe Biden&rsquo;s addiction is: His addiction to power and money. And it is the evidence of the former vice president&rsquo;s corruption, and the national security risk our country would face by electing Biden, that is the story of the MacBook hard drive, not the salacious, verified photographs and videos of Hunter Biden.</p>\r\n<p>For nearly a week, corporate media successfully ignored or downplayed news of the trove of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s emails, texts, photographs, and videos recovered from a laptop abandoned at a Delaware computer repair store. Then confirmation of the authenticity of the materials first reported in the New York Post, and the release of a second set of emails &mdash; also confirmed&mdash; from another source finally forced the press to acknowledge the issue.</p>\r\n<p>On Friday evening, CBS News&rsquo; Bo Erickson asked Joe Biden about the New York Post story as the Democrat candidate for president departed from a campaign stop in Michigan. &ldquo;I have no response. It&rsquo;s another smear campaign &mdash; right up your alley, those are the questions you always ask,&rdquo; Biden snipped at the long-time reporter.</p>\r\n<p>With more details coming out daily, this non-answer will not placate even a compliant press for long. Nor will the &ldquo;Russia disinformation&rdquo; narrative pushed by Biden&rsquo;s media boosters suffice because multiple confirmations of the evidence establish this story is not disinformation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s Not about Hunter&rsquo;s Addiction, It&rsquo;s about Joe&rsquo;s</strong></p>\r\n<p>So, the dissembling will start, with Biden attempting to make the story about his son&rsquo;s drug addiction. We already saw this when President Trump hit his opponent during the first presidential debate with the fact that once Biden &ldquo;became vice president [Hunter] made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.&rdquo; Biden&rsquo;s first response was outright denial: &ldquo;That is not true.&rdquo; But that won&rsquo;t work with the constantly accumulating evidence from the hard drive and the other independent emails.</p>\r\n<p>So Biden&rsquo;s second tack will likely be his campaign&rsquo;s official response once they regroup over the weekend: &ldquo;My son, like a lot of people at home, had a drug problem. He&rsquo;s overtaking it. He&rsquo;s fixed it. He&rsquo;s worked on it. And I&rsquo;m proud of him, I&rsquo;m proud of my son,&rdquo; Biden punched back during the first presidential debate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Senate Report Confirms Corruption</strong></p>\r\n<p>While Hunter Biden&rsquo;s highly lucrative position on the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma has received some press, the media all but ignored the U.S. Senate committee report on &ldquo;Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Corruption: The Impact on U.S. Government Policy and Related Concerns.&rdquo; This report not only details &ldquo;examples of extensive and complex financial transactions involving the Bidens, it also describes the quandary other U.S. governmental officials faced as they attempted to guide and support Ukraine&rsquo;s anticorruption efforts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>The report&rsquo;s key findings included concerns raised by &ldquo;officials in Vice President Joe Biden&rsquo;s office about the perception of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter Biden&rsquo;s role on Burisma&rsquo;s board,&rdquo; and a senior State Department official&rsquo;s warning to Vice President Biden or his staff &ldquo;that Hunter Biden&rsquo;s position on Burisma&rsquo;s board enabled Russian disinformation efforts and risked undermining U.S. policy in Ukraine.&rdquo; The report also confirmed that former Secretary of State John Kerry &ldquo;had knowledge of Hunter Biden&rsquo;s role on Burisma&rsquo;s board,&rdquo; even though he falsely denied that knowledge during a town hall event in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>The report was not limited to Hunter Biden&rsquo;s role on the Burisma board and the Obama-Biden administration&rsquo;s knowledge of that conflict of interest. The Senate committees also detailed Hunter&rsquo;s receipt of &ldquo;a $3.5 million wire transfer from Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow,&rdquo; and Hunter&rsquo;s opening of &ldquo;a bank account with Gongwen Dong to fund a $100,000 global spending spree with James Biden and Sara Biden,&rdquo; as well as his &ldquo;business associations with Ye Jianming, Gongwen Dong, and other Chinese nationals linked to the Communist government and the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Those associations,&rdquo; the report continued, &ldquo;resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow,&rdquo; some of which Hunter &ldquo;paid nonresident women who were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European countries and who appear to be linked to an &lsquo;Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Whistleblower Turns Over Hunter&rsquo;s Laptop</strong></p>\r\n<p>Then on Saturday, we learned from a letter sent by Sen. Ron Johnson, the chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to FBI Director Christopher Wray, that the report triggered &ldquo;a whistleblower&rdquo; to contact Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;committee and informed [his] staff that he had possession of a laptop left in his business by Hunter Biden,&rdquo; clearly the same source as behind the New York Post&rsquo;s story.</p>\r\n<p>The letter continued: &ldquo;He also informed us that he provided its contents to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in response to a December 9, 2019 grand jury subpoena.&rdquo; The FBI refused to confirm any or deny any information sought by the committee, including questions unrelated to ongoing grand jury investigations. Johnson stressed the importance of the FBI responding to the committee&rsquo;s inquiry: &ldquo;I have a responsibility to validate and verify the contents of any information produced to my committee. The committee must know if it receives information that could be fraudulent or not accurate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; Johnson&rsquo;s letter continued, &ldquo;if any information offered to the committee was linked to a foreign adversary&rsquo;s attempt to interfere in the election, I would expect the FBI to ensure the committee is protected and receives a defensive briefing.&rdquo; Additionally, as Johnson noted, &ldquo;knowingly providing false information to Congress is a crime.&rdquo; Johnson then listed a litany of questions concerning the laptop and the FBI&rsquo;s efforts to verify the authenticity of the material, asking for an answer by Oct. 22, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>It seems unlikely the FBI will respond to the inquiry, or at least not publicly, but to date, several outlets are claiming they confirmed the validity of the emails and other material on the hard drive, and the personal texts and photographs and videos released leave little doubt that the hard drive truly was Hunter Biden&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n<p><strong>This Is about Joe Biden, Not Hunter</strong></p>\r\n<p>That is the extent of the relevance of the personal information being released: The public does not need to know of the unsavory and illegal behavior Hunter engaged in&mdash;much less watch it&mdash;while he was in the throes of addiction. America also does not need to read the words of anguish exchanged between an addict son undergoing rehab and his famous father.</p>\r\n<p>Yet Hunter Biden&rsquo;s addiction, and the fact that tens of thousands of other Americans suffer similar demons, does not atone for the sins of the father. And that is what the email and text scandal concerns: Evidence that Joe Biden, while vice president of the United States, knowingly allowed his son to profit by selling access to Biden and others in the Obama administration, including to Communist Party of China leaders, and then lied about it.</p>\r\n<p>The emails and texts Joe personally received also suggest a cut from Hunter&rsquo;s influence-peddling. For instance, one email published by the New York Post detailed a deal Hunter Biden pursued with China&rsquo;s largest private energy company that was &ldquo;interesting for me and my family.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A May 13, 2017 email with the subject line &ldquo;Expectations&rdquo; listed expected &ldquo;renumeration packages&rdquo; for various individuals, including &ldquo;&lsquo;H,&rsquo; apparently referring to Biden.&rdquo; The Post noted that &ldquo;the deal also listed &lsquo;10 Jim&rsquo; and &lsquo;10 held by H for the big guy?&rsquo;&rdquo; but did not identify the &ldquo;big guy.&rdquo; However, sources have told Fox News &ldquo;&lsquo;the big guy&rsquo; is a reference to the former vice president.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A text recovered from the hard drive also suggests the former vice president may have received a cut of Hunter&rsquo;s &ldquo;earnings.&rdquo; &ldquo;I Hope you all cal do what I did and pay for everything for this entire family Fro 30 years,&rdquo; a screenshot of a text from January 2019 to Hunter&rsquo;s daughter read. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really hard. But don&rsquo;t worry unlike Pop I won&rsquo;t make you give me half your salary.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>This Compromising Material Is a National Security Risk</strong></p>\r\n<p>Evidence of this scandal is too strong to ignore or to allow Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, or corporate media to cast aside as an unseemly attack on a recovering drug addict, and not merely because of the corruption at issue. Every country, every foreign politician or political faction, and every corrupt oligarch or business that paid for access has the emails, notes, receipts, itineraries, fund transfers, and maybe even photographs or recordings. And that makes Joe Biden a national security risk.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, it was Acting Attorney General Sally Yates&rsquo; concern that then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was a national security risk that sent her to the White House to get him fired. The Russians would know, she maintained, that Flynn had misrepresented to Vice President Mike Pence his conversations with the Russian ambassador, and that would leave Flynn compromised. Of course, that theory was so preposterous that even disgraced former FBI Director James Comey called it a stretch.</p>\r\n<p>But there is a world of difference between a conversation among a transition team member and a foreign ambassador and a conversation between individuals with foreign interests and the former vice president, bought and paid for with cash funneled through his son. A compromise of that kind holds serious national security issues, which is why our country needs a full vetting of this evidence.</p>\r\n<p>If the emails and texts are fake, we need to know that. But all indications to date are that they are real, and spectacularly damning. And that has nothing to do with Hunter Biden&rsquo;s addiction, and everything to do with Joe Biden&rsquo;s unfitness for office.</p>', 'normal', 0, 1604119319, 0, 3),

As recently as April 2018, construction industry employment surged by 17,000 jobs. Notable developments in the energy industry include many large petrochemical projects across the Gulf Coast. Commercial construction is booming in most urban areas, exemplified by the recent completion in San Francisco of the 61-story Salesforce Tower. Major construction is anticipated as a result of the Trump administration&rsquo;s $1 trillion infrastructure plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Legal framework</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What primary and secondary legislation governs the construction sector in your jurisdiction?</em></p>\r\n<p>U.S. construction projects are subject to state-specific legislation such as anti-indemnity statutes, prompt payment acts, lien statutes, &lsquo;home court&rsquo; governing law and venue rules, and retainage statutes. State legislation may pertain to specific types of project as well. For example, the majority of states legislate public-private partnerships. Federal legislation interfaces with the construction sector only in specific circumstances, such as construction of a federal infrastructure project.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Authorities</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Which authorities regulate the construction sector and enforce construction law, and what is the extent of their powers?</em></p>\r\n<p>The state courts and private arbitral tribunals play the largest roles enforcing rights between contracting parties. They also enforce state-specific legislation touching on the construction industry, such as anti-indemnity statutes, prompt payment acts, lien statutes, &lsquo;home court&rsquo; governing law and venue rules, and retainage statutes. Federal regulatory authorities, and their state counterparts, may also oversee construction when the project interfaces with a regulated issue. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency oversees a project&rsquo;s environmental components, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulates worker safety, the Department of Labor has authority over issues such as minimum wage and overtime, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission governs transmission and wholesale sale of electricity and natural gas, while also regulating the transportation of oil by pipeline.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Licensing</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What licensing requirements and procedures apply to construction projects in your jurisdiction (eg, planning consents)?</em></p>\r\n<p>The applicable licensing requirements and procedures for construction projects vary depending on the type of construction (e.g., residential, commercial, or industrial) and the particular state. Licensing requirements are generally not stringent. Certain construction projects may also need to satisfy governmental inspection and permitting requirements, which again vary by state and municipality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>What licensing requirements and procedures apply to construction professionals, including any required qualifications?</em></p>\r\n<p>Most construction professionals are not required to have specific qualifications, as the primary gauge in the industry is years of experience and past projects successfully completed. Construction project owners and contractors may establish their own qualification requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Certain types of professional may need licenses or certifications, such as electricians, installers of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, and non-destructive testing professionals.</p>\r\n<p>Design professionals wishing to become licensed may do so by becoming professional engineers. The requirements for such licensure are state-specific, but often include a four-year college degree, years of work experience, and passing one or more exams. In some circumstances, again regulated on a state-by-state basis, a professional engineer may be required to sign, seal, or stamp technical documents.</p>\r\n<p><em>Do any special rules and restrictions apply to foreign construction professionals?</em></p>\r\n<p>Foreign construction professionals are not subject to any special rules and restrictions, apart from needing work authorization under U.S. immigration law. Several different visas are available to foreign workers, such as the H-2B Visa (for temporary non-agricultural labor) or the E-B3 Visa (for skilled workers, professionals, or non-temporary unskilled workers). From a practical standpoint, foreign construction professionals must be able to communicate fluently with the workforce, although some even rely on interpreters to assist in communications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project structures and relationships</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What corporate/formal structures are available for construction projects in your jurisdiction? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Are any structures explicitly prohibited?</em></p>\r\n<p>No corporate or formal structure is prohibited for construction projects, so long as it does not run afoul of business associations&rsquo; requirements (e.g., it cannot be a &lsquo;sham&rsquo; company). Owners and contractors can structure a project however they see fit, often relying on joint ventures (JVs), corporations, or limited liability companies. The benefits of different corporate formations depend on the circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>For large-scale projects, JVs are prevalent because one company rarely retains all of the requisite expertise or resources to succeed by itself. Further, due to the size of these projects, many owners and contractors desire to spread the completion risk across several balance sheets. Whether the JV is long term or short term depends on the different business needs of the JV partners, and the anticipated requirements of the project itself.</p>\r\n<p>Owners commonly use subsidiaries and special purpose project entities to help shield parent and affiliated companies from project-specific liabilities. Contractors may establish special purpose entities, but if they do, owners will generally require guarantees from the contractor&rsquo;s parent company.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Relationship management</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Are there any special considerations for managing relationships with:</em></p>\r\n<p>(a) Joint venture partners (where applicable)?</p>\r\n<p>The JV agreement should clearly lay out each partner&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities, how the JV ends, how important operational decisions will be made without reaching impasse among the JV partners, and how disputes between the JV members&mdash;and with third-parties&mdash;are to be resolved. Failure to do so can have serious implications on the project.</p>\r\n<p>A project&rsquo;s success often relies on the alignment of the JV partners, which should maintain constant contact with one another. Communications between the partners may not be protected by the attorney-client privilege (depending on the state); consequently, inter-JV communications on legally sensitive topics should be approached with caution.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(b) Contracting government entities in public-private partnerships (or other construction projects with a public element)?</p>\r\n<p>In a public-private partnership, the government entity seeks to meet its development needs with a reduced capital expenditure and to capitalize on private sector expertise to deliver assets cost-effectively and efficiently. One should define the division of services and allocation of risk between the private and public sector. Risks must be allocated with the entity best able to manage them, including construction risks (e.g., increased construction or delay costs) and operating risks (e.g., certainty of revenue stream, costs of servicing the project, and costs associated with performance issues). There are two key considerations in risk allocation: which entity can better control the occurrence of the risk, and which entity is better able to manage the impact of the risk. If too much risk is allocated to the private sector, it can result in increased bid costs and/or the private sector failing to meet its contractual obligations.</p>\r\n<p>(c) Subcontractors?</p>\r\n<p>The successful management of subcontractors requires transparency, constant communication, and a clearly defined scope of work. Subcontract terms and conditions must align with the degree of definition of the scope of work to be performed.</p>\r\n<p>There are often multiple subcontractors working on one construction project, so each must be treated fairly and equally (a &lsquo;sweetheart&rsquo; deal with one subcontractor will almost certainly lead to unrest and dissention between the other subcontractors and the contractor). It is important for both the owner and prime contractor to understand the rights and responsibilities of each subcontractor. Ideally, each subcontractor will have similar contracts, as failure to maintain consistent subcontracts can prove problematic. For example, all subcontracts should have identical dispute resolution provisions (e.g., requiring arbitration in the same forum and under the same rules). If a dispute should arise, inconsistent dispute resolution provisions could result in disputes across multiple forums.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(d) Architects, designers, engineers and any other related professionals?</p>\r\n<p>Managing relationships with design professionals requires constant communication across disciplines&mdash;between architects, engineers, and related professionals, as well as all downstream designers, fabricators, and constructors. Project managers should consider the important interplay between design and construction work. Sometimes cost or time-saving shortcuts in construction will nullify important aspects of the design.</p>\r\n<p>(e) Any other relevant parties typically involved in construction projects?</p>\r\n<p>Banks, lenders, and insurers play a large role in construction projects, especially large-scale ones. Loan covenants and insurance coverages can sometimes be implicated by decisions made during the execution phase of a project, so they should be carefully consulted whenever significant decisions are made that may depart from the original project plan.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Contracts and performance</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What standard contract forms are used for construction projects in your jurisdiction? To what extent do parties deviate from these standard forms?</em></p>\r\n<p>U.S. construction projects do not rely on one standard contract form. In fact, even when a form is used, the parties often make revisions. The most commonly used forms are those developed by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), or are state-specific. AIA forms are popular in commercial real estate and are considered architect-friendly, so owners and contractors often push for a negotiated AIA. ASCE forms are more common in the industrial context. Residential construction contracts, such as for single-family homes, often rely on forms established by individual states. While forms from the International Federation of Consulting Engineers are popular in Europe, they are typically not used in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>For larger projects, the parties often find it advantageous to negotiate their own contract, without relying on a standard form.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Definition of &lsquo;construction work&rsquo;</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How is &lsquo;construction work&rsquo; legally defined?</em></p>\r\n<p>There is not one single definition for &lsquo;construction work.&rsquo; Generally, individual states&rsquo; lien, anti-indemnity, or other construction-related statutes define construction broadly. The scope of work is usually defined by contract and will vary in specificity from project to project.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Governing law</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Are there any rules or restrictions on the governing law of construction contracts?</em></p>\r\n<p>Many states have &lsquo;home court&rsquo; rules specific to projects constructed in the respective state. While the language in each statute differs, the general rule is that a provision in a construction contract is void or voidable if it requires litigation to occur in, or be subject to the laws of, another state. To get around the venue rules, parties may agree to arbitrate, rather than require litigation in a specific court system. That said, any contractual provision purporting to require the application of the laws of a state other than the state where the project is being built could still run afoul of the home court rules. These governing law restrictions can be complicated when horizontal construction occurs across borders, such as a pipeline running through different states.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Formalities</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Are construction contracts subject to any formal requirements?</em></p>\r\n<p>Construction contracts are subject to state-specific requirements. Many states have requirements on issues such as retainage, anti-indemnity provisions, prompt payment, and waivers of negligence or gross negligence&mdash;to name a few. These requirements often differentiate between the type of project: residential, commercial, or industrial. When drafting a construction contract, the best practice is to review the contract law of the relevant state.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mandatory/prohibited provisions</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Are there any mandatory or prohibited provisions in relation to construction contracts?</em></p>\r\n<p>Whether a construction contract has prohibited provisions is subject to state-specific requirements. Every state has some restrictions on risk-shifting, but the extent of those restrictions varies. Similarly, the states scrutinize waivers of rights and responsibilities, as well as limitations of liability. Some states also restrict or prohibit the use of design-build delivery systems for public projects, although this method is becoming increasingly more popular in the public space. While there are restrictions, the states do not have mandatory contract provisions. When drafting a construction contract, the best practice is to familiarize oneself with the relevant state&rsquo;s contract law.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Implied terms</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Can any terms be implied in construction contracts?</em></p>\r\n<p>The terms most commonly implied in construction contracts are warranties, which are subject to state law. Both owners and contractors may be subject to implied warranties. Under the Spearin Doctrine&mdash;effectively adopted by all 50 states&mdash;there is an implied warranty of accuracy for any information that the owner shares with the contractor. This can be critical for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts, but the majority of states allow the parties to waive this implied warranty. Various implied warranties apply to the contractor&rsquo;s work, such as the implied warranty of merchantability and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to implied warranties, state-specific products liability and consumer protection laws may be implied by law into contracts.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Risk allocation</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How are risks typically allocated between parties to construction contracts?</em></p>\r\n<p>The contract delivery strategy dictates how liabilities are handled. A traditional design-bid-build model is one liability set that consciously separates the liabilities (e.g., the construction contractor is not responsible for design errors unless the contractor discovers the error and fails to report it). In the EPC context, greater risk falls on the EPC contractor. There are many ways to allocate risks between parties to construction contracts (e.g., indemnities, limitations of liability, risk of loss provisions, performance guarantees, etc.), and that allocation often depends on the parties. The liability structures also depend on the industry, what is being built, who can bear the risk, each parties&rsquo; financial wherewithal, economic undercurrents, geography, issues with union labor, and political considerations.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Limitation of liability</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How and to what extent can parties to construction projects contractually limit or exclude their liability?</em></p>\r\n<p>There are many ways to contractually limit or exclude liability, through clauses such as limitations of liability, risk of loss provisions, waivers of consequential damages, and waivers of implied warranties. The states have their own restrictions on such limitations. For example, most states will enforce a limitation of liability provision only if it is explicit, prominent, clear, and unambiguous. Indemnities are also used to limit liabilities, but the drafter should take into account construction anti-indemnity statutes. Because each state has its own requirements, one should always analyze the relevant state-specific rules when drafting a construction contract.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms to limit or exclude liability, the parties may also shape their liabilities with warranties and representations, as well as contractual limitations on when and how relief may be sought.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Liquidated damages</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How are liquidated damages typically calculated and to which liabilities are they usually applied?</em></p>\r\n<p>Liquidated damages are traditionally used as a remedy for delay (including the contractor&rsquo;s failure to mobilize or failure to complete its scope of work by a specified date), but they may also address performance elements. Interim liquidated damages can be based on delivery dates for multi-prime coordination.</p>\r\n<p>Most states have specific case law on how liquidated damages should be determined and when they will be held unenforceable. Generally speaking, most states require liquidated damages to be calculated based on a genuine pre-estimate of what the party believes its damages would be in the event of breach by the other party. The damage amount may consider lost profits related to failure to start up. For commercial real estate, it may be calculated based on lost real estate rental income. Liquidated damages amounts can also take into account debt service and the extension of corporate and on-sight overhead.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Force majeure</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How are force majeure clauses treated in your jurisdiction? Is there a legal definition of force majeure events?</em></p>\r\n<p>There is not a single legal definition of force majeure events in the United States, as these clauses are analyzed on a state-by-state basis. As a general rule, a force majeure event must be beyond the reasonable control of the party, or unforeseeable at the time the parties entered into the contract. Force majeure typically allows only for schedule relief, rather than cost relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties may choose to define force majeure in the construction contract as they see fit, and they may agree that cost relief will be available in certain limited circumstances. Force majeure is negotiated differently depending on the industry, location, what is being built, and how the parties want to handle risk. In many contracts, the parties will negotiate and agree upon an exclusive list of events that qualify as a force majeure event, rather than relying upon a general definition.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>General performance obligations</strong></p>\r\n<p>What are the general performance obligations of contractors and employers?</p>\r\n<p>The parties&rsquo; general performance obligations depend on many factors, including what is being built, how the delivery system is set up, the expectations for the project, and the express terms of the contract.</p>\r\n<p>Construction professionals are subject to various ethical and professional obligations. For example, engineers generally have a duty to perform to the standard of a reasonably prudent engineer, although the relevant contract may establish an even higher standard. For example, if the contract is an EPC contract, the standard in the industry is that there shall not be any defects in design or engineering, rather than relying solely on the standard of a reasonably prudent engineer. Contractors may also be subject to agency rules and fiduciary duties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Project delays</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How are project delays typically handled? Do any set rules, restrictions or procedures apply in this regard?</em></p>\r\n<p>Project delays are one of the most commonly litigated construction issues in the United States. Well-drafted contracts establish clear grounds for entitlement to relief for delay. Disputes often arise regarding who caused the delay and how to calculate the relief for such delay. The modern trend in most U.S. jurisdictions is to allow apportionment of fault for delays. Additionally, contractors often challenge liquidated damages for delay as unenforceable penalties. To overcome that challenge, the party seeking to recover liquidated damages must generally be able to show that the amounts were a genuine, good-faith pre-estimate of the damages that would be incurred in the event of delays.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Contract variations</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>To what extent can the parties make variations to the contract? Do any set rules, restrictions or procedures apply in this regard?</em></p>\r\n<p>A well-written contract will prohibit contractual variations unless it is done through a formal amendment or approved change order. Contract provisions are often found ambiguous, though, in which case most courts will allow some extrinsic evidence to resolve the ambiguity. In practice, this sort of evidence can change many core components of the parties&rsquo; arrangement. For this reason, even if the contract seems perfect, parties to a construction contract must stay engaged and ensure that the trail of paperwork properly reflects the contractual intent. The rules on contract variations exist on a state-by-state basis.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What are acceptable grounds for the termination of a contract?</em></p>\r\n<p>Typically, a contract may be terminated for convenience or cause. Termination for convenience is common in construction contracts and is usually available only to the owner. When properly described in the contract, it allows an owner to terminate its contractor at will, and pay for costs incurred by the contractor up to the termination date. These costs largely depend on the industry and contract.</p>\r\n<p>The contract should also define when an owner may terminate a contractor for cause. Termination for cause can be for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the contractor&rsquo;s failure to perform the work, refusal or failure to supply enough skilled workers, failure to pay its subcontractors, and insolvency. Sometimes the owner may replace the contractor for safety reasons or because the contractor has repeatedly disregarded applicable laws.</p>\r\n<p>The contractor can also terminate the contract for default, but that right is typically narrower.&nbsp; Justified reasons for doing so generally include the owner&rsquo;s failure to pay undisputed amounts under the contract after a grace period has expired.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Remedies for breach</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What remedies are available for the breach of construction contracts?</em></p>\r\n<p>The owner generally has several different remedies for the contractor&rsquo;s breach, including liquidated damages, termination of the contractor (for convenience or cause), and withholding payment. In certain circumstances, the owner may also pursue injunctive relief or specific performance. Under express and implied warranties, the owner can require the contractor to correct defects to its work, or pay for a third party to do so, then pass that cost on to the contractor.</p>\r\n<p>The contractor&rsquo;s remedies are often more limited, but may include termination for cause if the owner defaults. The contractor&rsquo;s primary remedy is an entitlement to additional cost or schedule extension when an owner breaches its obligations. In the event of non-payment, the contractor may also lien the project. This often requires the contractor to satisfy specific requirements, defined by each individual state.</p>\r\n<p>Either party may proceed under standard breach of contract theories. All of these remedies should be defined by the contract and may be addressed more generally by state law.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Financing</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What types of financing are used for construction projects in your jurisdiction? Which are the most common? Are there any restrictions on available financing methods?</em></p>\r\n<p>The different types of financing used for construction projects depend in large part on the size of the project. For smaller projects, such as residential or commercial construction, the contractor or bank will finance the company or the project itself. Public construction projects often rely on bonds (e.g., a municipal bond may raise funds for a sewer project), and the federal government will finance larger infrastructure projects (e.g., interstate highways). Many parties to large-scale projects use non-recourse project financing, where the lender provides financing based on the contract commitments and the equity in the project, and without a guarantee from the project owner or its affiliates or parent companies. Parties may also use balance sheet financing, where the company finances the project out of its own cash reserves.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What forms of security are used in construction project financing?</em></p>\r\n<p>It depends. Owners often require performance and payment bonds, letters of credit, parent company guarantees, and hold retainage to guaranty performance. Public-private partnerships will use surety bonds with a liquid element that is similar to a letter of credit. Bank guarantees are more common abroad, and less common in the United States.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Payment</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What are the typical methods and timing of payment for construction work? Are there any restrictions on &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; and &lsquo;pay if paid&rsquo; provisions? Do any other rules, restrictions or procedures apply?</em></p>\r\n<p>The timing of the owner&rsquo;s payment to the prime contractor is typically 30 days, although the payment term may be longer or shorter. The prime contractor&rsquo;s payment to subcontractors is often less than 30 days.</p>\r\n<p>Contract language is often unclear as to whether the parties intend to create a &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; or &lsquo;pay if paid&rsquo; arrangement. Conflicting interpretations of these clauses can mean the difference between subcontractors receiving payment within a reasonable time after the prime contractor is paid, or the subcontractors remaining unpaid until the prime contractor resolves disputes with the owner. These clauses are commonly litigated in state court, and many courts interpret ambiguities as creating a &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; arrangement. Common grounds for challenging a &lsquo;pay if paid&rsquo; arrangement includes arguing the clause is contrary to the parties&rsquo; intent, the clause is unconscionable, or the party has waived its right to enforce the clause by making partial payments.</p>\r\n<p>The most common restriction to these clauses is that the prime contractor is not permitted to enforce an otherwise valid contingent payment clause if the reason for the owner&rsquo;s non-payment is the prime contractor&rsquo;s own failure to comply with the contractual requirement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Non-payment</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How can the contractor secure itself against non-payment by the employer? Under what circumstances can the contractor suspend work for non-payment?</em></p>\r\n<p>The most common way for a contractor to secure itself against non-payment by the owner is by filing a lien against the project. Each state has its own rules describing the necessary steps to secure a lien, and many of these rules have very specific requirements. However, where project financing is used, the contractor should recognize that it will be required to subordinate its liens to the lenders.</p>\r\n<p>The contractor may also terminate the contract for default, usually after a contractually defined grace period. The parties can include other remedies in the contract to protect the contractor in the event of non-payment, including circumstances that expressly authorize suspension of the work.</p>\r\n<p><em>How can subcontractors secure themselves against non-payment by the contractor? Under what circumstances can subcontractors suspend work for non-payment?</em></p>\r\n<p>In the event of non-payment, subcontractors may lien the project, then require the owner and prime contractor to resolve the issue of non-payment. The availability of this relief, and the directions for how to file such a lien, are state-specific. The subcontractor should put the owner on written notice immediately if payments are past due. In many jurisdictions, such a &lsquo;fund trapping&rsquo; notice may require the owner to hold certain funds for the subcontractor or place them in a trust account until the subcontractor&rsquo;s dispute with the general contractor is resolved. The subcontractor may also begin the dispute resolution process based on the contractor&rsquo;s breach of contract.</p>\r\n<p>Generally, a subcontractor should be very careful about suspending work for non-payment as doing so may result in the subcontractor&rsquo;s own breach of contract. In the instance of the prime contractor&rsquo;s non-payment, it is important for the subcontractor to understand its rights and responsibilities under the contract before taking any action. This may be affected by the existence of a &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo; or &lsquo;pay if paid&rsquo; clause in the subcontractor&rsquo;s contract.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>On what grounds can payments be withheld?</em></p>\r\n<p>Payment can be withheld if the contract permits withholding and if the withholding does not run afoul of the respective state&rsquo;s prompt payment act.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Insolvency</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What recourse is available to employers in the event of the contractor&rsquo;s insolvency?</em></p>\r\n<p>In the event of the contractor&rsquo;s insolvency, the owner usually may terminate the contract for cause, provided that termination is not prohibited under applicable bankruptcy laws.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Insurance Coverage</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What mandatory insurance coverage applies to parties involved in construction projects? Is any additional coverage recommended?</em></p>\r\n<p>The United States has no uniform federal insurance law, and the types and amounts of coverage required vary by state. In most states, businesses with one or more employees are required to carry worker&rsquo;s compensation/employer&rsquo;s liability insurance, and businesses that own one or more automobiles are required to carry automobile liability insurance. Other recommended coverages for construction projects include:</p>\r\n<p>all risk/builders risk;</p>\r\n<p>commercial general liability;</p>\r\n<p>umbrella or excess liability;</p>\r\n<p>environmental/pollution liability;</p>\r\n<p>professional liability (including coverage for construction or design professionals);</p>\r\n<p>delay in start-up;</p>\r\n<p>marine cargo (insurance on equipment);</p>\r\n<p>property coverage (e.g., to cover damage to existing facility if the facility is on a brownfield site);</p>\r\n<p>employer premise liability;</p>\r\n<p>performance bonds/contractor default insurance;</p>\r\n<p>wharfingers coverage (e.g., if a ship hits a dock);</p>\r\n<p>crime and fidelity insurance;</p>\r\n<p>cyber liability insurance; and</p>\r\n<p>owners/contractors&rsquo; protective professional indemnity and liability insurance.</p>\r\n<p>The need for these coverages depends on the role of the entity seeking coverage (e.g., whether the design professional, construction contractor, or project owner is the insured). Certain coverages may be purchased on a project-specific basis&mdash;for instance, in the form of wrap-up programs or policies issued to joint ventures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tax issues</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What tax liabilities arise in relation to construction projects?</em></p>\r\n<p>A variety of different tax considerations must be taken into account for construction projects. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>\r\n<p>state-by-state sales and use tax;</p>\r\n<p>state and federal income tax;</p>\r\n<p>statutory and employment taxes, which may be depend on the corporate/formal structure for the project;</p>\r\n<p>import duties; and</p>\r\n<p>property taxes, including the local appraisal district&rsquo;s taxation of assets on the property (e.g., compressors or other equipment).</p>\r\n<p>Owners and contractors also need to be increasingly mindful of tariff issues.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incentives</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Are there any tax incentive schemes to promote construction and development in certain areas?</em></p>\r\n<p>The availability of tax incentive schemes to promote construction depends on the state. There are often manufacturing or process exemptions for construction projects such as refineries or processing plants. In these situations, sales and use tax exemptions may be available. It is important for an owner to explore possible tax incentives before committing to build the project in a particular locale.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Environmental issues</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What environmental protection legislation and regulations apply to construction projects in your jurisdiction?</em></p>\r\n<p>Construction projects that are built on previously used land may trigger applicability of remediation provisions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Remediation liability is strict liability, and a party cannot claim that it acted in accordance with industry standards, or even that it acted negligently only, to avoid liability. CERCLA liability applies retroactively, and holds the potentially responsible parties jointly and severally liable. Most states have equivalents to CERCLA and RCRA (although the restrictions and protections vary greatly), including &lsquo;voluntary clean-up&rsquo; programs that can offer liability protection for a new project.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Authorisation/certification</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What environmental authorisations and certifications are required for construction projects and how are they obtained?</em></p>\r\n<p>Construction projects are required to comply with a range of environmental laws, including obtaining any applicable permits or other authorizations, and these may include federal authorizations and equivalents that are state-specific. The most commonly required authorizations for construction activities include air permits (particularly for concrete batch plants and diesel generators), stormwater (for construction runoff), and spill prevention and reporting. Certain projects may also require permits for water use, hydrostatic testing, noise, and waste management. In addition, other authorizations are often required to address potential land use impacts. These may include a general environmental impact review, as well as more specific clearance for impacts to wetlands and waters, threatened or endangered species, archaeological or historical sites, and navigable airspace. Every project needs construction permits from the local jurisdiction. How each is obtained varies widely by municipality, county, and state.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Green&rsquo; regulations and incentives</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Are there any regulations or incentive schemes in place to promote the construction of energy-efficient and low-carbon buildings?</em></p>\r\n<p>While the United States has incentive schemes to promote the construction of green energy projects, the most recent tax reform has reduced some of those incentives. Many states and municipalities will provide tax abatements and deferments for green construction, which is especially common in the residential and commercial space.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Employment issues</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What employment and labour legislation applies to construction projects in your jurisdiction? What rights and protections are provided to construction workers?</em></p>\r\n<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act establishes minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for construction worker &lsquo;employees&rsquo; across the United States, in addition to state-specific rules that may establish more stringent standards. While individuals classified as &lsquo;independent contractors&rsquo; are not subject to the same protections, the Department of Labor is increasingly suspicious of misclassifications of employees as independent contractors.</p>\r\n<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration protects the health and safety of construction workers, and the states may promulgate more stringent standards. The states&rsquo; worker&rsquo;s compensation laws also provide insurance protections for injured workers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Occupational health and safety</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What occupational health and safety regulations apply to construction projects?</em></p>\r\n<p>Construction projects are subject to the health and safety regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and analogous state agencies, which may choose to promulgate more stringent standards.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Employment contracts</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What types of employment contract are typically used for constructions work? Are there any mandatory or prohibited provisions in relation to employment contracts?</em></p>\r\n<p>Construction workers are contracted as employees or independent contractors. This structure depends on many factors, including the size and scope of the project. A construction company with a small employee base may choose to contract with a large number of independent contractors. Other companies will use a subcontractor, or even its own subsidiary, as a staffing contractor. Most states regulate the scope of non-competition agreements and tend to strictly construe them.</p>\r\n<p>Some projects use union labor, but the strong trend is towards at-will employment, subject to state-specific provisions. Many states regulate the scope of non-competes in employment contracts.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Foreign workers</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What rules, restrictions and considerations apply to the hiring of foreign workers?</em></p>\r\n<p>Foreign workers are not subject to any special rules and restrictions, apart from needing work authorizations under U.S. immigration law. There are several different visas available to foreign workers, such as the H-2B Visa (permitting employers to hire foreign workers to perform temporary non-agricultural labor) or the E-B3 Visa (providing work certification to skilled workers, professionals, or non-temporary unskilled workers).</p>\r\n<p>Often there are state and municipal tax incentive schemes with local content requirements. While not a restriction, this often incentivizes the employment of local workers instead of foreign workers. Hiring foreign workers can also create issues with local unions. For large-scale projects, especially those anticipating hiring thousands of workers, hiring foreign workers can cause unwanted political and media attention.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Anti-corruption rules</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What regulations and procedures are in place to combat corruption, bribery, fraud, collusion and other dishonest practices in the construction sector in your jurisdiction?</em></p>\r\n<p>The primary restrictions on corruption and bribery come from the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which broadly prohibits paying or offering anything of value to government officials and employees of government-owned or government-controlled businesses. Within the United States, the domestic bribery statute prohibits similar conduct as to U.S. government officials. Many states also have enacted prohibitions on commercial bribery that prohibit paying or offering benefits to employees of private companies to obtain an improper business advantage.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Best practices</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What best practices are advised to ensure compliance with the relevant anti-corruption rules?</em></p>\r\n<p>Compliance with applicable restrictions depends on strong internal policies and procedures that are explained to employees in routine training sessions. Successful compliance programs combine consistent communications from senior management about the importance of compliance and ongoing monitoring of potentially risky activity, including standardized processes for vetting agents and other third parties operating on behalf of the company.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dispute resolution</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What courts are empowered to hear construction disputes in your jurisdiction? Are there any specialist construction courts?</em></p>\r\n<p>State courts most commonly preside over construction disputes, though construction disputes are brought to federal court when the court has diversity jurisdiction or there is a federal question at play. The parties&rsquo; contract may identify an agreed court for litigation, although these provisions cannot confer jurisdiction on a court if it is otherwise lacking, and the parties must be careful of &lsquo;home court&rsquo; venue rules. In addition to traditional litigation, many parties choose to resolve disputes through arbitration. The American Arbitration Association and International Institute for Conflict Prevention Resolution are two of the most commonly used institutions to administer U.S. domestic construction arbitrations.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Common disputes</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What issues are commonly the subject of construction disputes?</em></p>\r\n<p>The issues most commonly the subject of construction disputes are:</p>\r\n<p>breaches of contract;</p>\r\n<p>liquidated damages;</p>\r\n<p>delay and disruption damages;</p>\r\n<p>limitations of liability;</p>\r\n<p>breaches of express and implied warranties;</p>\r\n<p>non-payment by the owner or prime contractor;</p>\r\n<p>disputes related to change orders, and amendments to the contract, or the scope of work; and</p>\r\n<p>occasionally, fraud or fraudulent inducement claims based on representations made before or during the course of the construction project.</p>\r\n<p>There are many additional issues&mdash;such as employment, environmental, or IP concerns&mdash;that can intersect with a construction dispute.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Statute of limitations</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>What is the statute of limitations for filing construction-related claims?</em></p>\r\n<p>The statute of limitations for construction-related claims depends on both the state and the underlying cause of action. When contemplating a specific claim, the best practice is to review the statutes of limitation for the relevant state, as well as considering tolling, how each state describes the discovery rule, and any relevant statute of repose.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mediation</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Is pre-litigation mediation required or advised for construction disputes?</em></p>\r\n<p>Pre-litigation mediation is not required for construction disputes, although it is often required under the contract. Recently, mechanisms like Dispute Resolution Boards and Dispute Adjudication Boards are being used to resolve in-project disputes on larger projects. It is often advisable to require some level of dispute resolution or mediation between the parties before formal disputes are initiated.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>How often is arbitration used to resolve construction disputes? What arbitration forms and institutions are typically used?</em></p>\r\n<p>Arbitration is becoming increasingly common in the construction dispute context, and more parties are requiring arbitration in their contracts.

(17, 1, 9, 0, 29, 0, 0, 'Obama Money Laundering Coverup', 'Obama Administration Covered Up Tax Evasion Scandal', '<p>At the centre of the renewed efforts to prove that the administration had misled the public were recently revealed e-mails that indicated State Department and other administration officials had asked that references to the al-Qaeda-linked group Aná¹£Är al-SharÄ«Ê¿ah and prior warnings of danger be stricken from the talking points to be used by UN Ambassador Susan Rice when she appeared on television news programs several days after the attack. Republican critics alleged that these changes showed that the administration had &ldquo;scrubbed&rdquo; Rice&rsquo;s remarks in order not to tarnish Obama&rsquo;s record on security during the run-up to the presidential election. The Obama administration dismissed the claims of a cover-up as politically motivated and contended that the process of developing the talking points was concerned not with politics but with differences between individuals in the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency regarding the yet-to-be-understood nature of the attack. (The focus of much Republican criticism regarding the attack was Hillary Clinton, who had resigned as secretary of state in February&mdash;to be replaced by John Kerry&mdash;but who was a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.)</p>\r\n<p>The administration found itself on the defensive when employees of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were accused of having used excessive scrutiny to delay approval of tax-exempt status for some conservative political groups. Obama condemned this &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; by the IRS as &ldquo;inexcusable,&rdquo; requested and received the resignation of the acting commissioner of the IRS, and promised that the Treasury Department would establish safeguards to ensure that such behaviour would not recur.</p>\r\n<p>Also troubling for the president were revelations that in spring 2012 the Justice Department had subpoenaed access to the records of some 20 phone lines used by reporters and editors who worked in several offices of the Associated Press without notifying that organization. This action had been taken as part of a widespread investigation into a national-security news leak related to a terrorist plot, hatched and foiled in Yemen, to blow up a U.S.-bound plane. Learning in May 2013 that the Justice Department had subpoenaed access to these phone records without having notified them, representatives of the Associated Press, as well as some legislators from both parties, said that they were deeply disturbed by what they saw as an egregious violation of the freedom of the press. Attorney General Eric Holder (who had earlier recused himself from involvement with the investigation because he had been questioned as part of it) characterized the investigation as involving one of the &ldquo;most serious leaks&rdquo; he had ever encountered. The Obama administration responded in part by calling for renewed pursuit of legislation that would create a federal &ldquo;shield&rdquo; law to provide the same sort of protection that many state laws provided for the confidentiality of journalists&rsquo; sources and communications. All three scandals became the focus of congressional investigations.</p>\r\n<p>June brought a new set of problems for the administration when it was forced to respond to the revelation that the National Security Agency (NSA) had compelled a telecommunications company to turn over metadata (such as numbers dialed and duration of calls) for millions of its subscribers. This secret information was leaked to The Guardian newspaper by American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who also disclosed the existence of a program that mined data from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other Internet-related companies for the NSA, the FBI, and a British agency. Snowden, who was charged with espionage, ended up in Russia, where he was granted temporary refugee status, further straining relations between that country and the United States, which were already at loggerheads over developments in the Syrian Civil War.</p>\r\n<p>Russia&rsquo;s continued support of its ally Syria (as well as that of China) prevented the UN Security Council from responding forcefully to the war. Obama, seemingly seeking to avoid open-ended involvement in another Middle Eastern conflict, had been cautious in his response to the situation in Syria, prompting some critics to label him the &ldquo;avoider-in-chief.&rdquo; As the death count in Syria rose and reports surfaced of the use of chemical weapons by the forces of Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad, the engagement of the U.S. government increased. Food and financial aid from the U.S. were extended to the Syrian opposition in February 2013, and the beginning of military aid was promised in June. Obama had said in May 2012 that what he called his &ldquo;calculus&rdquo; for U.S. involvement in Syria would change if &ldquo;we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized.&rdquo; That &ldquo;red line&rdquo; appeared to have been crossed when hundreds of people died allegedly as a result of Syrian government forces&rsquo; use chemical weapons in suburban Damascus on August 21, 2013.</p>\r\n<p>On August 30 U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that the United States had &ldquo;high certainty&rdquo; that chemical weapons had been used in the incident and that government forces had carried out the attack. He also reported a death toll (more than 1,400) that was considerably higher than earlier estimates. The Syrian government continued to deny its use of chemical weapons and blamed the opposition. Although the British Parliament had voted against endorsing Prime Minister David Cameron&rsquo;s call for military intervention in principle, Obama indicated that a U.S. military response would be forthcoming, even without British involvement. French Pres. Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, on the other hand, continued to express support for French involvement in a military response. On August 31 Obama shifted gears and asked for congressional authorization for military action while awaiting the findings of UN weapons inspectors who had returned from Damascus after inspecting the site of the attack. Released on September 16, their report indicated that there was &ldquo;clear and convincing evidence&rdquo; that surface-to-surface rockets had delivered the nerve agent sarin in the attack. The report did not indicate blame for the attack. In the meantime, on September 14, Russia and the United States brokered a framework agreement under which the Syrian government would accede to the international Chemical Weapons Convention and submit to the controls of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, release a comprehensive listing of its chemical weapons arsenal within a week, destroy all of its chemical mixing and filling equipment by November, and eliminate all of its chemical weapons by mid-2014. While the Obama administration indicated that the framework included an appeal to the UN Security Council to authorize the use of force should Syria not fulfill the terms of the agreement, the Russian government said it had not agreed to that condition.</p>\r\n<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s foreign policy in the region was also being tested by events in Egypt, where the military had removed Pres. Mohammed Morsi from power in July. Because the U.S. government was legally prohibited from providing financial aid (which amounted to more that $1 billion annually for Egypt) to countries whose leadership changed as the result of a coup, the administration hesitated to label the change in power a coup. However, Obama was adamant in urging a swift return to civilian rule, and the stakes went up when hundreds of Morsi&rsquo;s supporters were killed by government forces in separate incidents in July and August.</p>\r\n<p>Obamacare remained a thorn in the side of Republicans, particularly those associated with the Tea Party movement, who led an attempt to include a one-year delay of funding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in a continuing resolution to fund the federal budget that faced an October 1 deadline. The president, for his part, promised to veto the resolution if it contained defunding of Obamacare. After the House Republican majority refused to give up its requirement of a funding delay for Obamacare and the Senate Democratic majority refused to endorse a continuing resolution that included that requirement, the federal government partially shut down for the first time in 17 years, furloughing hundreds of thousands of employees and closing government offices. Obama was adamant that any discussion on the budget would be contingent upon fully reopening the government, and he maintained that stance as the October 17 deadline for extending the national debt ceiling approached and with it the threat of default. On October 16, moderate Republicans voted with Democrats in both houses of Congress to pass a bill forged by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that ended the partial shutdown by funding government agencies and offices through January 15, 2014, extended the government&rsquo;s borrowing power through February 7, and tasked a negotiating committee with coming up with long-term budgetary solutions. By the end of 2013 the House and the Senate had passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, based on a compromise that replaced the bulk of the automatic spending cuts required by sequestration with targeted cuts and raised discretionary spending (divided evenly between military and nonmilitary funding). The resulting budget was intended to last through the 2014 fiscal year.</p>\r\n<p>With the temporary resolution of the budget battle, public attention shifted to the troubled rollout of Obamacare in early October 2013 and to the initially miserable performance of HealthCare.gov, the Web site that acted as a marketplace for insurance plans and the place for those in 36 states to apply for health coverage. Republicans lambasted the Web site, which was often slow and erratic or simply inoperable. Far fewer users were able to access the site and apply for insurance than had been hoped, prompting the administration to order a &ldquo;tech surge&rdquo; in late October. Progress in overcoming the glitches was slow, but as HealthCare.gov&rsquo;s performance improved, Obama went on the offensive, encouraging Americans to sign up for coverage. At the beginning of April 2014, after the end of the first open enrollment period, he announced that 7.1 million Americans had signed up for private insurance plans through the marketplace, meeting the administration&rsquo;s target. &ldquo;The debate over repealing this law is over. The Affordable Care Act is here to stay,&rdquo; Obama declared, yet criticism of Obamacare and calls for its removal remained a rallying cry for Republicans as they prepared for the 2014 midterm congressional election.</p>\r\n<p>Events in the Middle East continued to make that region an important focus of Obama&rsquo;s foreign policy in 2014. However, the president&rsquo;s attention dramatically shifted early in the year to a developing crisis in Ukraine. After widespread protests led to the impeachment and then the end of the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych (who called his dismissal a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat), elements within the predominantly ethnically Russian autonomous republic of Crimea, supported by Russian troops, engineered Crimea&rsquo;s self-declared separation from Ukraine and annexation by Russia (confirmed by the Russian parliament in March). Obama joined a host of Western leaders in condemning Russia&rsquo;s aggressive actions and sought to isolate it by suspending it from the Group of Eight and imposing sanctions on a number of individual Russian leaders. Moreover, in a show of support for Ukraine, Obama met with its newly elected president, Petro Poroshenko, in early June.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of May, five Taliban leaders who been prisoners at the Guant&aacute;namo Bay detention camp were exchanged by the Obama administration for Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. Army sergeant who had been a captive of the Taliban in Afghanistan since 2009. The exchange was initially hailed as a victory for the administration, but it quickly became controversial. Some Republicans argued that the administration had given up too much for Bergdahl, and politicians from both sides of the aisle criticized the president for failing to consult Congress prior to the exchange (law required the administration to give Congress notice 30 days before releasing Guant&aacute;namo Bay detainees; the White House cited evidence of Bergdahl&rsquo;s failing health and other factors that necessitated urgent action). The matter became further clouded by the ambiguous circumstances of Bergdahl&rsquo;s capture, including allegations that he had attempted to desert.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in early summer 2014, nearly three years after the removal of the final U.S. troops from Iraq, Obama found himself forced to again respond to events there, when the controversial U.S.-supported regime of Prime Minister NÅ«rÄ« al-MÄlikÄ« was threatened by the takeover of several cities (including the country&rsquo;s second largest, Mosul) by a rapidly spreading Sunni insurgency spearheaded by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria [ISIS] and as the Islamic State), a group that emerged in April 2013. Some critics sought to blame Obama for this new instability in Iraq, accusing him of having removed U.S. troops too soon. The president remained reluctant to put &ldquo;boots on the ground,&rdquo; even as he dispatched some 300 U.S. Special Operations troops in mid-June to train, advise, and support Iraqi security forces, and he called on the Iraqi government to resolve the situation. MÄlikÄ«&rsquo;s State of Law coalition had won the largest number of seats in parliamentary elections in April 2014, paving the way for MÄlikÄ« to claim a third term as prime minister, but in response to pressure from former supporters both inside and outside Iraq, he stepped aside in favour of a less-divisive figure from the State of Law coalition, Haider al-Abadi, who was nominated to form a new cabinet in early August.</p>\r\n<p>On August 8 the United States began to launch air strikes against ISIL in Iraq to prevent it from advancing farther into Kurdish territory. In September Obama responded even more aggressively to ISIL&rsquo;s advances in both Iraq and Syria, as well as to a growing sense of the terrorist threat posed by ISIL elsewhere (brought home to Americans through videos released by ISIL depicting the beheadings of two U.S. journalists held hostage by the group). In a televised address on September 10, Obama announced that he had initiated a significant escalation of the campaign against ISIL, including the authorization of air strikes inside Syria for the first time and an increase of those in Iraq. Although he continued to pledge that he would not return U.S. combat troops to the region, Obama asked Congress to approve some $500 million for the training and arming of &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; Syrians. In the following weeks, as U.S.-led attacks increased, Obama championed an effort to grow the coalition of countries that had committed to confronting ISIL. By the end of September, some 20 countries were contributing air support or military equipment to the coalition effort, including France, Britain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar, and Bahrain. Dozens of other countries provided humanitarian aid.</p>\r\n<p>An effort to expand that coalition and to define the necessity of combating ISIL&rsquo;s &ldquo;network of death&rdquo; was central to Obama&rsquo;s speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 24. Also in that address he echoed his September 10 speech in denouncing Russia&rsquo;s actions in Ukraine, and he called on the world to come together to respond to global warming and to help contain the outbreak of the Ebola virus in Africa. A number of political observers praised the president for putting the United States at the forefront of these efforts after having been, in their eyes, recently indecisive in his foreign policy.</p>\r\n<p>Immigration reform&mdash;an issue that Obama had attempted to address in June 2012 with executive action that deferred for two years deportations of immigrants who had come to the United States illegally as children&mdash;was back in the spotlight in 2014 as a crisis arose along the country&rsquo;s border with Mexico. From October 2013 to mid-June 2014 some 50,000 unaccompanied children from Central America were apprehended attempting to enter the U.S. illegally. In July the administration sought $3.7 billion from Congress to confront the crisis.</p>\r\n<p>In early August 2014 Obama carefully sought not to take sides when the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American teenager, by a white police officer resulted in days of civil unrest and protests fueled by tensions between the predominantly Black population of Ferguson, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, and its predominantly white government and police department. The president did, however, cite the incident in his September speech to the UN as an example of &ldquo;our own racial and ethnic tensions&rdquo; while pointing to the failure of Americans at times &ldquo;to live up to our ideals.&rdquo; On September 19 there was a scare at the White House when, only minutes after the first family had left the residence, a man leapt the surrounding fence and made his way into the White House. The security breach spurred a congressional hearing that addressed other recent lapses by the Secret Service, and soon afterward its director, Julia Pierson, resigned.</p>\r\n<p>On November 20 Obama once again employed an executive order in an attempt to overcome legislative gridlock when he announced reform of U.S. immigration policy that would grant work permits and temporary legal status to more than four million illegal immigrants. The action would delay deportation and allow parents of children who were legal residents or U.S. citizens to apply for three-year work permits, provided that they had been in the country for five years or more. The order also removed the age limitation from the president&rsquo;s 2012 executive order regarding immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children and changed the year by which they were required to have immigrated from 2007 to 2010. Vowing to counteract the order, Republicans accused Obama of skirting Congress and engaging in an imperial presidency.</p>\r\n<p>In December 2013, at a memorial for South African leader Nelson Mandela, Obama and Cuban leader Ra&uacute;l Castro had shared a handshake that seemed to offer symbolic new hope for improved Cuban-U.S. relations. On December 17, 2014, after some 18 months of secret negotiations fostered by Canada and the Vatican, that handshake bore fruit as Obama and Castro simultaneously addressed national television audiences to announce the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba that had been suspended in January 1961. &ldquo;We will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests,&rdquo; Obama said. At the beginning of his administration, he had hoped to restart relations, but that initiative had been undermined by the incarceration of Alan Gross, a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) who had been held in Cuba since 2009 after being convicted of importing illegal technology and attempting to establish secret Internet service for Cuban Jews. The announcement of renewed diplomatic relations was accompanied by the release of Gross and a prisoner exchange of three Cuban intelligence agents who had been jailed in the United States since 1998 for a U.S. intelligence agent who had been captive in Cuba for nearly 20 years.</p>\r\n<p>In December Obama&rsquo;s response to police violence was again questioned after a grand jury failed to indict a New York City policeman for his responsibility in the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed African American man who died after having a choke hold applied to him during his arrest on Staten Island in July. The president and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio established a task force charged with improving relations between minority communities and police, but many of those around the country who had taken to the streets to proclaim that &ldquo;Black lives matter&rdquo; felt that Obama was not doing enough.</p>\r\n<p>Baltimore riot, Charleston shooting, Supreme Court approval of same-sex marriage, and agreement with Iran</p>\r\n<p>The first half of 2015 was a roller-coaster ride of low and high points for the president: on one hand, the country continued to experience a rash of deeply troubling incidents of race-related violence, while, on the other hand, the Supreme Court ruled as the administration had hoped it would in a pair of landmark cases.</p>\r\n<p>In an episode reminiscent of the events in Ferguson and Staten Island, on April 19 a young African American man in Baltimore died a week after incurring a severe spinal-cord injury while in police custody. Rioting erupted in Baltimore on the day of his funeral, April 27. As troubling as the incidents of police violence and the issues of police accountability were, the country was even more stunned and saddened when, on June 17, nine African Americans were shot and killed, allegedly by a young white man, in a hate crime in a historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina. In his eulogy for one of the shooting&rsquo;s victims&mdash;the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, a South Carolina state senator&mdash;Obama addressed gun control, race relations, and the symbolic impact of the Confederate flag, which he said represented more than just &ldquo;ancestral pride&rdquo; because for many it was a &ldquo;reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation.&rdquo; (In the wake of the shooting, the flying of the Confederate flag at the state capitol in South Carolina was the object of renewed criticism, and on July 10, in response to legislative action by South Carolina lawmakers, the flag was removed permanently from the capitol grounds.)</p>\r\n<p>Environmentalists were able to claim a victory in November 2015 when Obama, having completed a seven-year review, announced that he had rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Supporters of the pipeline had argued that construction of the pipeline would create jobs and promote economic growth, while opponents countered that extracting the petroleum from tar sands in Alberta would contribute significantly to global warming.</p>\r\n<p>The August 14 flag raising presided over by Secretary Kerry at the reopened U.S. embassy in Havana provided a foreign policy milestone for the Obama administration, after the U.S. and Cuba had officially opened their embassies in each other&rsquo;s capital on July 20. At the end of July, Obama had become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Ethiopia as well as the first U.S. chief executive to address the African Union at its headquarters in Addis Ababa. In early October, after some eight years of negotiations, another of the president&rsquo;s principal foreign policy objectives appeared within reach with the signing in Atlanta of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a regional trade deal between 12 Pacific Rim countries (the U.S., Japan, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam). Congressional ratification of the treaty, however, was far from a certainty.</p>\r\n<p>Republicans and some members of his own party continued to criticize Obama&rsquo;s response to ISIL as insufficient and flawed. Having admitted in June 2015 that the administration still did not have a &ldquo;complete strategy&rdquo; to confront ISIL (and still suffering for his 2014 characterization of ISIL as the &ldquo;junior varsity&rdquo; in comparison with al-Qaeda), Obama, at the end of October 2015, authorized the deployment of several dozen special-operations troops in Syria to help coordinate local ground forces in the north of the country and undertake other open-ended missions there&mdash;an action that seemed to violate his long-standing promise to not &ldquo;put boots on the ground&rdquo; in Syria. The measure came at a time when Russia had become directly involved in the Syrian Civil War, and the deployment was framed as part of an evolving policy that included a significant diplomatic effort to begin talks aimed at effecting a political transition in Syria.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of the new year, Obama returned again to the matter of gun violence. Long frustrated by congressional gridlock that prevented the passage of gun-related legislation, on January 5, 2016, he announced executive actions aimed at expanding background checks for gun purchasers and recodifying the definition of a regulated gun dealer. Mindful of the kind of Republican accusations of presidential overreach that had landed earlier executive actions in the courts, Obama was careful to undertake action that he described as &ldquo;well within&rdquo; his legal authority. The redefinition of regulated gun dealing targeted online sales of guns and sales of weapons at gun shows that had not been subject to background checks. In his announcement of the executive action, Obama, reflecting on the tragedy of the 2012 Newtown shootings that had deeply affected him, wiped tears from his cheeks as he said, &ldquo;Every time I think about those kids it gets me mad. And by the way, it [gun violence] happens on the streets of Chicago every day.&rdquo; Several days later, at a special televised town meeting at George Mason University, Obama discussed his executive action with both supporters and opponents of gun-control reform.</p>\r\n<p>When Obama came before a joint session of Congress on January 12 to deliver his final State of the Union message, there was an empty seat in the gallery next to Michelle Obama to symbolize the loss of life brought about by gun violence. The president struck a positive tone in his address, countering fears of Islamist terrorism by calling the United States &ldquo;the most powerful nation on Earth&rdquo; and characterizing gloomy Republican assessments of the country&rsquo;s economic decline as &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; while saying that the U.S. has &ldquo;the strongest, most durable economy in the world.&rdquo; Rather than recite a litany of policy initiatives, Obama, echoing former president Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Four Freedoms&rdquo; address, focused on four pivotal questions that were summarized on the White House&rsquo;s Web site:</p>\r\n<p>Historic trips and more shootings</p>\r\n<p>The death of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia in early February provided Obama with the opportunity to replace one of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s staunchest judicial conservatives. In March the president nominated the highly regarded moderate Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as Scalia&rsquo;s replacement, but Senate Republicans had already vowed not to hold confirmation hearings for any new justice until after the 2016 presidential election.</p>\r\n<p>Returning to an issue that he had first tackled early in his presidency, on February 23, 2016, Obama announced that the Department of Defense had submitted to Congress a new plan for closing the U.S. detention facility at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba. He called the camp a stain on the U.S. record of upholding the rule of law and said that its continued operation was &ldquo;counterproductive to our fight against terrorists, because they use it as propaganda in their efforts to recruit.&rdquo; Ongoing Republican opposition had frustrated attempts by Obama to have some of the detainees transferred to the United States, but throughout his presidency he had overseen the transfer of detainees to countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Georgia, Senegal, Bosnia, Slovakia, and Uruguay, with more than 180 detainees having left Guant&aacute;namo under Obama&rsquo;s watch while several dozen detainees remained.</p>\r\n<p>In March Obama welcomed a state visit by Canada&rsquo;s youthful new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, whose presence created the kind of excitement that had always seemed to attend the charismatic Obama at the beginning of his own tenure in office. The amiability between Obama and Trudeau was a far cry from Obama&rsquo;s chilly relationship with Canada&rsquo;s former leader, Conservative Stephen Harper.</p>\r\n<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s advocacy of civil rights took a variety of forms in 2016. In early May Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis met with local officials to discuss the creation of a national monument commemorating the gay rights movement at the Stonewall Inn, the historic Greenwich Village bar where police and gay rights activists had clashed in 1969. Later that month U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the Department of Justice&rsquo;s filing of suit in federal district court in support of the transgender community to block the enforcement of a recently adopted North Carolina state law that required public agencies to limit the use of restrooms, locker rooms, and changing rooms to persons whose biological sex (as indicated on their birth certificates) corresponds to the sex for which the facility is intended.</p>\r\n<p>Gun violence continued to shake the country. In June Obama and Vice President Biden traveled to Orlando, Florida, to meet with survivors and families of victims of the mass shooting earlier that month at the Pulse nightclub, the deadliest such event in modern U.S. history. Forty-nine people were killed and 50 others were wounded in the attack by a lone gunman on the vibrant centre for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) social life. Less than a month later, on July 7, in downtown Dallas, as a peaceful protest against the shootings earlier in the week of African American men by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and suburban St. Paul, Minnesota, was winding to a close, a sniper who was upset by those shootings shot and killed four police officers, along with a rapid transit officer, and wounded several others. Speaking at a memorial for the slain officers, Obama said:</p>\r\n<p>Faced with this violence, we wonder if the divides of race in America can ever be bridged. We wonder if an African-American community that feels unfairly targeted by police, and police departments that feel unfairly maligned for doing their jobs, can ever understand each other&rsquo;s experience.&hellip;I&rsquo;m here to say we must reject such despair. I&rsquo;m here to insist that we are not as divided as we seem.&hellip;Because with an open heart, we can learn to stand in each other&rsquo;s shoes and look at the world through each other&rsquo;s eyes, so that maybe the police officer sees his own son in that teenager with a hoodie who&rsquo;s kind of goofing off but not dangerous&mdash;and the teenager&mdash;maybe the teenager will see in the police officer the same words and values and authority of his parents.&hellip;We can decide to come together and make our country reflect the good inside us, the hopes and simple dreams we share.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of July, as one of the keynote speakers at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Obama eloquently praised Hillary Clinton, the party&rsquo;s nominee to replace him in the Oval Office, but, arguably, the convention&rsquo;s most-rousing speech had been delivered a few days earlier by the first lady, Michelle Obama. The president campaigned actively in support of Clinton, whose Republican opponent, real-estate developer and reality television star Donald Trump, had vowed to undo many of Obama&rsquo;s policy and legislative achievements. Upending the predictions of polls and pundits, Trump won the election, capturing key battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to triumph in the Electoral College with 304 electoral votes to 227 for Clinton, though she won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes.</p>\r\n<p>I am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists; that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice; that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon; a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written: Yes, we can.</p>\r\n<p>Life after the presidency</p>\r\n<p>Having chosen to become the first president since Woodrow Wilson to remain in the capital after the end of his term, Obama purchased a nine-bedroom home in the Kalorama neighbourhood with the intention of staying for two years so that his younger daughter, Sasha, could complete high school in Washington. Although he indicated at his final press conference that he did not intend to be actively involved in politics, he outlined several developments that could reverse that decision, including &ldquo;systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion,&rdquo; the creation of obstacles to voting, and efforts to silence the press or dissent.</p>\r\n<p>The former president and former first lady received a joint $65 million advance from Penguin Random House&rsquo;s Crown Publishing Group for their respective memoirs. Obama also began undertaking high-paid speaking engagements, including addresses to Wall Street financial firms, which earned him as much as $400,000 an outing as well criticism from some corners for his acceptance of extravagant fees. Supporters countered that those high fees contributed to making it possible for Obama to donate some $2 million to job-training programs for low-income residents in the Chicago area.</p>\r\n<p>Jackson Park, on Chicago&rsquo;s South Side, was chosen by the Obama Foundation (founded in January 2014) as the location for the Obama Presidential Center. Intended as an economic engine for the South Side, nestled in parkland, and dedicated to informing and inspiring future leaders, the centre was designed to include a library, museum, athletic facility, and forum for public meetings. It also was planned to serve as the headquarters for the Obama Foundation and the My Brother&rsquo;s Keeper Alliance, the organization Obama founded in 2014 to provide opportunities for boys and young men of colour. The former president also indicated his support for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization led by former attorney general Eric Holder that was focused on executing a comprehensive redistricting strategy to counter what it saw as the abuses of Republican gerrymandering.</p>\r\n<p>Even as the Trump administration rolled out a succession of policy initiatives seemingly aimed at eradicating Obama&rsquo;s achievements in the realms of health care, climate change, immigration, and financial regulation, Obama for the most part honoured the unwritten tradition of former presidents&rsquo; refraining from criticism of their successor&rsquo;s actions. On occasion, though, Obama did take issue with some of Trump&rsquo;s policies and the direction in which Trump was taking the country. Notably, Obama was critical of Trump&rsquo;s decisions to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change and from the 2015 agreement with Iran on nuclear development, as well as Trump&rsquo;s order to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>\r\n<p>In 2020 Obama began to take a noticeably more active role in American political life. In particular he was critical of Trump&rsquo;s handling of two crises that had shaken the country: the coronavirus pandemic that had taken more than 160,000 lives in the United States by August and put the economy in a tailspin, along with the killing of George Floyd, an African American, by a Minneapolis policeman that sparked prolonged nationwide protests reflecting the festering indignation at the continuing epidemic of police brutality toward African Americans and systemic racism. In early June Obama participated in an online town hall on police violence.

Practicing &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo; emblematic of the effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the two men discussed a range of issues, including the steps required to tame the pandemic and resuscitate the economy, and Obama expressed confidence in the character and leadership ability of Biden, who had tied his candidacy to his role in the Obama administration and his friendship with the popular former president. At the end of the month, Obama delivered a moving eulogy at the funeral of one of his heroes, congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis.</p>\r\n<p>Jeff WallenfeldtBowman was born in Iran and spent much of her childhood traveling abroad, as her father was a physician who assisted developing countries in establishing health care systems. In 1963 her family settled in Chicago. (Bowman&rsquo;s grandfather Robert Taylor was the first African American head of the Chicago Housing Authority.) She later attended Stanford University (A.B., 1978) and the University of Michigan Law School (J.D., 1981). In 1983 she married William Robert Jarrett, a physician; the couple divorced in 1988.</p>\r\n<p>Working in corporate and real estate law until 1987, Jarrett moved into politics when she became deputy counselor for finance and development in the administration of Chicago Mayor Harold Washington. After Washington&rsquo;s death, Jarrett remained with the mayor&rsquo;s office and accepted several positions in the administration of his successor, Richard M. Daley. She served as Daley&rsquo;s deputy chief of staff and later as a planning commissioner. Jarrett was also chair of the Chicago Transit Authority from 1995 to 2003, and she served as chairman of the board for the Chicago Stock Exchange from 2004 to 2007. Beginning in 1995, she was executive vice president of the Habitat Company, a property management firm responsible for overseeing portions of Chicago&rsquo;s public housing system. Jarrett became CEO of the company in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>Jarrett was long associated with Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, whom she had hired as an assistant in 1991 while working for Daley. Jarrett developed an ongoing personal and professional relationship with the couple. She served as the finance chair of Obama&rsquo;s 2004 Senate campaign and was treasurer of his political action committee. During Obama&rsquo;s presidential campaign, Jarrett mediated between Obama and members of the African American community who were concerned about the implications of his candidacy, and she also served as an envoy to those who had supported Obama&rsquo;s primary rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton. After Obama&rsquo;s election in November 2008, she served as cochair of his transition team. Later that month it was announced that Jarrett had been appointed senior adviser to Obama.</p>\r\n<p>Jarrett became a highly influential member of Obama&rsquo;s inner circle and a forceful advocate of the president&rsquo;s agenda. She was also known for advancing progressive measures, such as the inclusion of free birth control in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010). Jarrett helped Obama win reelection in 2012, and she continued to serve as senior adviser until his second term ended in 2017. She later wrote the memoir Finding My Voice: My Journey to the West Wing and the Path Forward (2019).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'normal', 0, 1604371280, 0, 21);

What vital U.S. interest is threatened there? Bombing Libya. Why should Washington bail out the Europeans yet again? Nationâ€â€‹building in Afghanistan. Did any American imagine that more than a decade after 9/11 U.S. personnel would be dying trying to create a modern centralized nation state in Central Asia?</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s the unnecessary, counterproductive, and duplicitous invasion of Iraq. The hypocritical and wasteful attack on Serbia over Kosovo. Foolish deployments in Somalia and Haiti. Bizarre little wars against Grenada and Panama. Crazy intervention in Lebanon.</p>\r\n<p>American presidents appear to go to war simply because they can do so. The U.S. is the planet&rsquo;s most powerful military power. No one forces the president to obey the constitutional requirement for a congressional declaration of war. So why not unleash death and destruction from time to time? Sadly, doing so seems to be the best way for presidents to get a high rating from historians.</p>\r\n<p>About the only positive thing is that today&rsquo;s wars are less costly than in the past &mdash; to America, at least. Some 200,000 Iraqi civilians probably died in the civil carnage following the U.S. invasion, more than 44 times the number of American deaths.</p>\r\n<p>However, the consequences would be far worse for this nation if Washington managed to get into a shooting war with Russia or China. That may not seem likely, but it is possible. During the Russiaâ€â€‹Georgia war in 2008 the Bush administration apparently considered military intervention; Washington has ambiguously committed to Taiwan&rsquo;s defense against China. Wars in both of those cases could lead to nuclear exchanges.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, past policymakers have exercised no better judgment. The U.S. ended up in an extended and costly conflict in Vietnam out of fear that dominoes would fall to the communists. America&rsquo;s Cambodian and Vietnamese allies collapsed &mdash; to be followed by the fall of communist dominoes years later.</p>\r\n<p>The Korean War grew out of a series of dubious decisions by Washington &mdash; dividing and occupying the Korean peninsula, allowing the emergence of an authoritarian and belligerent ally, and failing to arm the Republic of Korea. Nearly six decades later the U.S. is still entangled in the Korean peninsula, defending its populous and prosperous dependent even as the latter subsidizes its bankrupt adversary, North Korea.</p>\r\n<p>World War II at least featured serious aggressors with serious ambitions. But World War II did not occur in a vacuum. It reflected the unfinished business of the Great War, later called World War I. And it is World War I which gave birth to Veterans Day.</p>\r\n<p>World War I may be the best illustration of stupid Washington policymakers unnecessarily getting involved in stupid wars which cost far more than any conceivable benefits. President Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s decision to take America into this conflict offers powerful evidence that he was the worst president in American history.</p>\r\n<p>Americans never were pacifists. They let neither moral scruples nor treaty technicalities get in their way of dispossessing Indians of the North American continent. Americans tried to conquer Canada, seized half of Mexico in a war with dubious justification, and killed some 200,000 Filipinos to impose Washington&rsquo;s will on what had been Spain&rsquo;s colony. However, Americans still generally followed George Washington&rsquo;s celebrated advice to avoid permanent &ldquo;foreign entanglements&rdquo; with the Old World.</p>\r\n<p>That was smart advice. The Europeans continued to engage in periodic wars which were of no interest to Americans. In the 19th Century alone there were the seemingly endless Napoleonic wars, many conflicts in the Balkans, a couple of wars between Russia and Turkey, conflicts growing out of the 1848 revolution, multiple wars of Italian independence against Austroâ€â€‹Hungary, Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire battling Imperial Russia in the Crimean War, and Prussia&rsquo;s wars with Denmark, Austria, and France.</p>\r\n<p>Americans wisely minded their own business as Europeans busily slaughtered each other again and again.</p>\r\n<p>But Woodrow Wilson took a different approach. Arrogant and overbearing, with a touch of megalomania, he was determined to reshape the world in his image. His militaristic tendencies were first evident in Mexico and Central America.</p>\r\n<p>World War I broke out in August 1914. It was a tragic and foolish war, wrecking Europe at a time of rising prosperity and increasing liberty. None of the European powers threatened America &mdash; whoever prevailed would not be launching an expeditionary across the Atlantic. Despite the historical bias towards the Entente, there really was little to choose from between the contending sides.</p>\r\n<p>The Central Powers, especially Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire, had obvious faults. But Imperial Germany and Austroâ€â€‹Hungary were complicated semiâ€â€‹democratic systems. Indeed, Germany&rsquo;s franchise was broader than that in Britain and France.</p>\r\n<p>On the Entente side, Britain, France, and Belgium were democracies, but also colonial powers which held tens of millions in bondage. Belgium&rsquo;s record in the Congo was particularly appalling. Italy joined the allies in search of territorial booty. Serbia was a bloodâ€â€‹stained regime, built on the murder of the prior monarchs. Indeed, a Serb terrorist with links to the Serbian government triggered the war by assassinating the Austroâ€â€‹Hungarian Archduke, the empire&rsquo;s heirâ€â€‹apparent.</p>\r\n<p>The only sensible policy for America was to stay out.</p>\r\n<p>For a time President Wilson did so. But his administration was filled with fans of Great Britain, a perspective magnified by the nation&rsquo;s financial, media, and political elite. London also ran a brilliant propaganda campaign, cutting the transâ€â€‹Atlantic cable connecting Europe to America and concocting fake German atrocities. The result was a concerted campaign to push the U.S. into war.</p>\r\n<p>In time President Wilson came to lead this effort. Europeans rejected his mediation efforts and he realized that the only way he could influence the war&rsquo;s settlement was to make America a participant. His excuse for taking the U.S. into the conflict was Germany&rsquo;s resumption of submarine warfare. Yet he did little to overturn Britain&rsquo;s starvation blockade of Germany, which harmed American commerce and was illegal under international law.</p>\r\n<p>More important, Wilson&rsquo;s position regarding submarine warfare was ludicrous. He claimed that Americans had an absolute right to book passage on British ships acting as reserve cruisers carrying munitions through a war zone. The British could mix bullets and babies with U.S. support. Indeed, the famed passenger liner Lusitania went down after a secondary explosion of the ammunition that it was carrying.</p>\r\n<p>Although it took time for the U.S. to mobilize, American forces made a critical difference. Germany defeated Russia, but it was not enough. When Germany&rsquo;s Western Front cracked Berlin had to ask for an armistice, which took effect on November 11, 1918. A peace treaty was reached the following year, but Wilson proved to be an ineffective negotiator, mercilessly rolled by the far more adept and ruthless European leaders.</p>\r\n<p>The peace settlement at Versailles turned into a scandalous grab for plunder, violating most of Wilson&rsquo;s celebrated &ldquo;Fourteen Points.&rdquo; Critics pointed out that almost every provision planted a seed for conflict, that the agreement was but an armistice for 20 years. The allies fell between two stools: a Carthaginian peace which might have kept Germany down and a conciliatory peace which might have strengthened the new Kaiserâ€â€‹less German democracy. Instead, the allies managed to antagonize Germans of all perspectives, aiding Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power without preventing Berlin from eventually rearming and taking revenge.</p>\r\n<p>As a result of Wilson&rsquo;s delusions of grandeur, 117,000 Americans died and another 206,000 were wounded in World War I. For them the U.S. marked Armistice Day, which in 1954 became Veterans Day in order to honor all American veterans.</p>\r\n<p>But it is worth remembering the original name. Americans who fought and died in World War I should be honored, but those who sent them into combat deserve to be disgraced. The U.S. should not have entered that conflict. America was not threatened by the war and gained no advantage from the peace.</p>\r\n<p>To the contrary, Woodrow Wilson helped make possible the rise of fascism, Nazism, and communism and create the conditions which sparked World War II. Without American intervention, there likely would have been a compromise peace. Reconstructing the continent would have been difficult, but there may have been no fascist government in Italy and almost certainly no Nazi regime in Germany. Even communism might not have existed: it was only because the liberal revolutionaries in Russia foolishly continued the war after deposing the Tsar that the Bolsheviks took power. Without the prospect of American aid, the provisional government might have made peace, forestalling Lenin&rsquo;s catastrophic coup.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, no power likely would have had an incentive and ability to start another war a couple decades later. The consequences of a continuing stalemate would have been unpredictable and ugly, but almost any outcome would have been better than what occurred. There may be no better example of the unintended consequences of war than what followed the Great War.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes war is a tragic necessity. However, most of America&rsquo;s conflicts have been unnecessary wars of choice. When Veterans Day makes its next appearance we again should honor America&rsquo;s veterans. But we also should denounce the scoundrels who continue to foolishly sacrifice the lives of so many of America&rsquo;s best and brightest. That is the most important lesson of Veterans Day.</p>', 'normal', 0, 1605177346, 1, 2),

Bahrain and Sudan joined the agreements, called the Abraham Accords, soon thereafter.</p>\r\n<p>Already, the wheels of the administration&rsquo;s Mideast project are turning again. Later on Sunday, Pompeo traveled to the Saudi Arabian city of Neom, where he met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A State Department readout did not indicate that they discussed the recent normalization agreements, but according to the Wall Street Journal, citing Hebrew-language media reports and original reporting, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined them.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident there&rsquo;ll be more nations that will follow,&rdquo; Pompeo told NR hours earlier, during the sit-down interview in the Emirati capital. &ldquo;The reason I&rsquo;m confident, by the way, is because it&rsquo;s the right thing for those countries to do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pompeo&rsquo;s ten-day trip unfolded to the backdrop of domestic political turmoil and effectively served as a Trump administration farewell tour and foreign-policy victory lap. Visits to Middle Eastern countries highlighted what officials regard as one of the crowning diplomatic achievements of the past four years.</p>\r\n<p>In his interview, Pompeo spoke to the strategic sea change that the administration contends made all this possible.</p>\r\n<p>According to the secretary of state, it took the widespread acknowledgement of three factors to reach the Abraham Accords. In addition to acknowledgement of the central threat posed by Iran and Israel&rsquo;s established place in the region, he said, it also required recognizing that while resolution of the Israeli&ndash;Palestinian conflict is important, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t stand by as we have for 40 years and allow that conflict to be the precondition for further enhancement of peace and stability.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Pompeo summed up: &ldquo;We broke glass. We said we&rsquo;re not going to do that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Amid the widespread focus on President Trump&rsquo;s efforts to contest the election results back home, Pompeo&rsquo;s travels in the Middle East did not avoid controversy. Critics charged that he staged provocative photo ops &mdash; such as one at an Israeli settlement in the West Bank and another in the Golan Heights, areas internationally regarded as Palestinian and Syrian territory, respectively &mdash; for an eventual presidential run. But the Trump administration has recognized Israeli sovereignty over Golan and withdrawn a State Department legal opinion calling the West Bank settlements illegal, as part of the suite of policies it has advanced to support Israel and clamp down on Iran&rsquo;s activities in the region.</p>\r\n<p>Another way to view Pompeo&rsquo;s recent travels is as an attempt to shore up confidence in U.S. leadership in the region as Joe Biden prepares to take office in January.</p>\r\n<p>Although leaders of the Middle Eastern nations that Pompeo visited this month &mdash; Israel, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia &mdash; have already congratulated the former vice president on his victory, they are also worried by his campaign-trail promises to reenter the Iran deal. (Pompeo also met the emir and foreign minister of Qatar, which also congratulated Biden but has closer ties to Iran than the other Gulf states.) Biden has pledged that he would reenter the Obama-era agreement from which Trump withdrew in 2018 if Tehran stopped violating its terms.</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s also the question of whether the incoming administration shares the assessment advanced by the United States, Israel, and now the Gulf states that the Israeli&ndash;Palestinian peace process can no longer stand as a prerequisite for a broader peace in the region, and whether it would back Israel to the extent that the Trump administration has.</p>\r\n<p>When Pompeo went to Jerusalem for meetings and joint statements with Israeli officials and the Bahraini foreign minister last week, Netanyahu said, &ldquo;Frankly, this day would not have happened, these Abraham Accords would not have been signed, without President Trump&rsquo;s crucial support and leadership.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Still, Biden&rsquo;s decision to nominate Tony Blinken, a former top State Department official in the Obama administration, as Pompeo&rsquo;s successor, might ease some of those worries. Blinken is seen as supportive of strong U.S.&ndash;Israel ties.</p>\r\n<p>In any case, the regional dynamics unleashed by the Trump administration&rsquo;s diplomacy over the past four years do not seem to be dissipating anytime soon. Noting Israel&rsquo;s previous ties with Gulf states, skepticism of Iran, and the desire for economic cooperation, a senior State Department official told reporters traveling with Pompeo that &ldquo;the roots are present, so I don&rsquo;t think these are going to go away.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that we play an important role in helping to strengthen that, these ties, bring them along,&rdquo; said the official. &ldquo;But the inclination is already there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Asked on Sunday if he had a message for Biden and other Democrats who have called for returning to the Iran deal, Pompeo demurred. He&rsquo;s also played his cards close to the vest regarding the election itself, since staking out his position that the transition begins with Electoral College certification of the results in December.</p>\r\n<p>He instead offered a message to people &ldquo;all across America,&rdquo; telling National Review, &ldquo;we have now demonstrated that the false choice that was put to the American people, that we either do the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] or we go to war, was a false choice.&rdquo; The JCPOA is also known as the Iran nuclear deal.</p>\r\n<p>Pompeo also declined to offer specifics on the next countries that might join the Abraham Accords and the timeline on which they&rsquo;d do it, deferring to those countries&rsquo; internal deliberations as sovereign nations and emphasizing a monumental shift in attitudes toward Middle East peace.</p>\r\n<p>The central understanding for so long was that without resolving the conflict with the Palestinians, we can&rsquo;t recognize Israel and the right of Israel to exist,&rdquo; he told National Review. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find very few who continue to hold to that vision.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', 'normal', 0, 1606179833, 0, 3),

The humerus is shorter and the forearm longer thereby approximating the ape form.</p>\r\n<p>The eye often has a yellowish scierotic coat over it like that of a gorilla.</p>\r\n<p>The negro has a shorter trunk; the cross-section of the chest is more circular than Whites. Similar to an ape.</p>\r\n<p>The pelvis is narrower and longer as it is in an ape.</p>\r\n<p>The negro has a larger and shorter neck akin to that of apes.</p>\r\n<p>The ears are roundish, rather small, standing somewhat high and detached thus approaching the ape form.</p>\r\n<p>The jaw is larger and stronger and protrudes outward which, along with lower retreating forehead, gives a facial angle of 68 to 70 degrees, like an ape, as opposed to a facial angle of 80 to 82 degrees for Europeans.</p>\r\n<p>The three curvatures of the spine are less pronounced in the negro than in the white and thus more characteristic of an ape.</p>\r\n<p>The two bones proper of the nose are occasionally united, as in apes.</p>\r\n<p>Taxonomists and geneticists believe that negros should be classified as different species. In fact, Darwin declared in The Descent of Man that the negros are so distinct that similar differences found in any other animal would warrant their classification as a different species.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>References:</p>\r\n<p>Coon, Carleton S.
